    "query": "What is an integrative course?",
    "response": "An integrative course is a type of course that combines both theoretical instruction and practical application. It goes beyond traditional lectures by engaging students in discussions, reflections, and exercises that prompt them to integrate their knowledge into real-world scenarios. This approach not only deepens their understanding of the material but also prepares them for future applications of their learning. The goal of an integrative course is to create a holistic learning environment where students can engage in activities beyond the classroom and make connections between these experiences. It is designed to bring together faculty, instructors, and graduate students interested in exploring ways to help students reflect on and connect what they do within and beyond their curriculum, embrace multiple perspectives, and synthesize and transfer their knowledge to new, complex situations. The objective is to obtain a deeper understanding of the ideals of integrative and experiential learning and develop a toolbox of simple techniques to engage students in reflection on their experiences within and beyond the classroom.",

    "response": "An undergraduate degree program typically consists of a series of courses that students take to earn their bachelor's degree. At the University of South Carolina's College of Education, students can choose from various undergraduate programs with different credit hour requirements and course selection guidelines. For example, to earn a Bachelor of Arts or Science and a Master of Teaching degree, students must maintain a minimum overall GPA of 2.75, complete an undergraduate major based on their desired teaching subject, and take a mix of education and subject-specific courses. Additionally, students may need to complete certain prerequisites or additional courses depending on their chosen undergraduate program and content teaching area. It's essential for students to consult with their advisors to ensure they meet all requirements before registering for courses.\n\nIn summary, an undergraduate degree program involves completing specific coursework and meeting particular requirements to earn a bachelor's degree. Students should work closely with their advisors to ensure they fulfill all necessary criteria for their chosen program.",

This requires approval by the department head and college representative, followed by submission through APPS (the online system used for course Actions Office). The proposal or change request must include justification and be approved by the college representative, Faculty Senate, or Graduate Council. Once approved, the Integrative Course designation can be added, which ensures awareness and attention to foundational skills woven throughout the curriculum. The unit head has regulatory oversight over these courses. However, the ultimate authority lies with the faculty senate, which can approve or reject proposals to create, revise, or terminate courses. Proposals for course changes are submitted in APPS. If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, it requires approval from the Unit Head, College Representative, Curricula and Courses Committee, or Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Similarly, if changing an existing course, it must be approved by the Unit Head, College/School Representative, Curricula, the question of how the process for course actions does not seem to have any relevance to the context of the Provost to ensure that all readings meet the academic expectation of the University.",

These deadlines may vary by course, so it's essential to check them individually. Generally, dropping a course after the add/drop deadline but before the tuition refund deadline will result in no grade assignment and potential loss of some or all tuition paid for the course. After the tuition refund deadline, no grade will be assigned for the dropped course. Still, a student might be eligible for a partial tuition refund depending on the course and the timing of the drop. The amount refunded varies and is determined by the University Registrar's webpage on withdrawal(https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/registration/withdrawal/index.php), we cannot predict the exact amount of tuition refunded. However, we know that after the tuition refund deadline, no grade will be assigned for the dropped course.",

Specifically, they must meet the admission requirements of both programs, maintain a GPA of at least 3.00, and complete at least 12 credit hours that count toward both undergraduate and graduate degrees. These conditions ensure that the quality and integrity of each degree involved is maintained. Furthermore, the context suggests that dual degree graduates can apply for dual credit through an Accelerated Bachelor\u2019s/Graduate Study Plan, which combines courses from both undergraduate and graduate programs. This plan must be reviewed and approved by the Graduate Council. So, yes, dual degree graduates are allowed to sit with the college of their choice, subject to the aforementioned conditions.",
