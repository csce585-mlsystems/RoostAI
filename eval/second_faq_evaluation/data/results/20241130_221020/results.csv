3,Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,"tag:

---

It appears that there have been some changes to the cross-listed course(s). Here are some questions and potential responses:

1. Does the cross-listed course syllabus propose one or more learning outcomes? If so, are these consistent with the original course syllabus? If not, does the syllabus of the cross-listed course reflect the same learning outcomes?

Potential Response: 

---

Yes, the cross-listed course syllabus proposes one or more learning outcomes. However, these outcomes are not identical to those in the syllabus of the original course. There are some differences in the learning outcomes between the original and cross-listed courses. I understand that the cross-listed syllabus might stipulate learning outcomes that differ from the original course syllabus:

41,What does each drop/add/w date mean?

After the tuition refund deadline, no grade will be assigned for the dropped course. Still, a student might be eligible for a partial tuition refund depending on the course and the timing of the drop. The amount refunded varies and is determined by the University Registrar's webpage on withdrawal(https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/registration/withdrawal/index.php), we cannot predict the exact amount of tuition refunded.
