question,answer
Can a program include more than one concentration?,"Yes,programs may have multiple concentrations within the major."
Can I choose specific (prescribed) courses as part of the Carolina Core for my program?,Yes. Certain programs may require courses that are approved as Carolina Core foundational courses. It makes sense that those programs would “prescribe” those courses as required for the particular Carolina Core component that they fulfill.
Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Getting approval for distributed learning for one cross-listed course does not automatically approve cross listed courses for distributed learning delivery. Separate submissions are required for each course. (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf)
Do prerequisites have to be enforced in Banner?,"Prerequisites do not have to be enforced in Banner. However,it is recommended that they be enforced,as they are published in the Bulletin. It creates inconsistency in University sources to list prerequisites on the Bulletin,but then not enforce them in Banner."
How do Carolina Core Overlay courses work?,"Carolina Core overlay courses meet two Carolina Core learning outcomes in one course. Students may apply a maximum of two overlay courses to their Carolina Core hours. All students must have a minimum of 31 hours of Carolina Core.

"If my program has multiple concentrations,will a change to the program affect all of the concentrations?","Concentrations are specific areas of study within the major. Anything outside of a concentration is part of the base program. If the change is to the Carolina Core,College Requirements,Program Requirements,or Major requirements (outside of the concentration),then the change will affect all concentrations. If the change is within a specific concentration itself,then it will not affect other concentrations in the program."
What are critical courses on the major maps?,"Courses may be marked as critical if there is a deadline for completion or if they may cause a delay in graduation because they serve as a prerequisite in a series of courses,have prescribed sequencing,or have limited offerings. There is a description of why courses are critical for a particular program in the first program note on the back of each major map. Critical courses are explained with examples in the Major Maps Training Module . (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iJrJTDzKCQ&feature=youtu.be)"

What is a cognate?,"""A cognate is series of courses that display a distinct curricular pattern in one or more disciplines different from the major. Undergraduate cognates require a minimum of 12 credit hours in advanced level courses related to,but outside the major. Graduate cognates range between 9 and 18 credit hours. Cognates are variable according to what is appropriate as determined by the student and the major advisor. Thus,cognates are not subject to faculty governance review,and do not appear on either the transcripts or the diplomas."" (ACAF 2.00)"
What is a concentration?,"""A Concentration is a series of courses that display a distinct curricular pattern within the major. They are often called options,emphases,tracks,areas,fields,or specializations. These are different from minors or cognates which are typically outside of the major. Concentrations are subject to faculty governance review,and appear on the transcripts but not the diplomas."" (ACAF 2.00)"

"When do cross-listed courses require additional proposals,and not just letters of concurrence?","Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Anytime a course is being deleted. If multiple cross-listed courses are being deleted,separate proposals are needed. Anytime a new course is being created. If a new course is to be cross listed with another new course,two proposals are needed (one for each course). If a new course is going to be cross listed with an existing course,only one proposal is needed. The proposal that creates the new course can also create the cross list,but does need a letter of concurrency. (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf)"
When is a syllabus required for a proposal?,"Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: A syllabus should only be included in a proposal when necessary. When a syllabus is included,it will be reviewed by the Committee on Curricula and Courses.

The program percentages must be based on the total number of credits required to earn the degree,not on the number of required credits in the major,minor or course,or the number of contact hours. SACSCOC may also request more information or additional materials such as a prospectus for any action."
What does each drop/add/w date mean? Will I still get money back for dropped classes?,"The last day of drop/add is the last day you can drop a class without being assigned a W. While a W doesn't affect your GPA,financial aid and academic progression standards require that you earn a certain number of hours each year. After the W date,you'll earn an F for each course you drop. Talk with your adviser and financial aid counselor before you make changes to your schedule. Refunds are pro-rated according to the Registrar's schedule."
