Can a program include more than one concentration?,"Yes,programs may have multiple concentrations within the major.","
In general, universities like the University of South Carolina offer programs with multiple concentrations or specializations within their majors. This allows students to explore interdisciplinary connections while still developing depth in an area of interest. Typically, such an arrangement enables students to tailor their studies to align with career goals or personal passions. However, whether this option is available would depend on the particular program and department at USC. Therefore, for detailed information regarding a specific program, I would recommend checking the official USC website or contacting the appropriate academic department directly."
Can I choose specific (prescribed) courses as part of the Carolina Core for my program?,Yes. Certain programs may require courses that are approved as Carolina Core foundational courses. It makes sense that those programs would “prescribe” those courses as required for the particular Carolina Core component that they fulfill.,"
Yes, you can choose specific courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program. These courses should meet the learning outcomes identified in the template syllabi of approved Core courses. Instructors may add additional course content, but the essential outcomes must be covered. An interactive list of Faculty Senate-approved courses meeting the Carolina requirements is available online, along with prototypical syllabi for all Carolina Core courses. You can select a course from the approved list to view the syllabus or see the Carolina Core Syllabus Requirements for Teaching [pdf]."
Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Getting approval for distributed learning for one cross-listed course does not automatically approve cross listed courses for distributed learning delivery. Separate submissions are required for each course. (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf),Changes made to a cross-listed course may or may not apply to the other cross-listed courses depending on how the course syllabus is set up and managed by the instructor(s). It is best to contact the instructor directly for accurate and current details regarding your specific cross-listed course situation.
Do prerequisites have to be enforced in Banner?,"Prerequisites do not have to be enforced in Banner. However,it is recommended that they be enforced,as they are published in the Bulletin. It creates inconsistency in University sources to list prerequisites on the Bulletin,but then not enforce them in Banner.","
Prerequisites are essential for ensuring students have the necessary background and skills before enrolling in certain courses. Typically, these requirements are managed within the university's Student Information System (SIS), such as Banner. However, whether or not prerequisites are enforced through the system depends on the policies and procedures set by the University of South Carolina. You should reach out to your academic advisor or department directly for accurate and up-to-date information regarding prerequisite enforcement at USC."
How do Carolina Core Overlay courses work?,"Carolina Core overlay courses meet two Carolina Core learning outcomes in one course. Students may apply a maximum of two overlay courses to their Carolina Core hours. All students must have a minimum of 31 hours of Carolina Core. For a list of overlay-eligible courses,visit the Carolina Core website and sort by the Overlay column in the table. Learn more with the Carolina Core Overlay Training Module (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/courses/foundational-courses.php,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bed1TZJfbhs&feature=youtu.be&t=2m55s)","
Answer:

Carolina Core Overlay courses are designed to allow students to meet two Carolina Core component requirements within a single course. This enables students to save time and potentially reduce the overall number of credits needed to graduate. Each overlay course combines elements of two separate components, providing students with a more efficient way to fulfill their degree requirements. A maximum of two overlays is permitted, and the total number of Carolina Core credit hours should still amount to a minimum of 31 hours. However, individual programs might require additional hours."
How do I change my program learning outcomes?,Learning Outcomes are placed in the Academic Assessment Plan Composer . Please contact La Trice Ratcliff-Small in OIRAA with any questions regarding learning outcomes. (http://assessmentplan.ipr.sc.edu/),"
To change your program learning outcomes, you would need to follow the guidelines provided by the University of South Carolina's Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) on learning outcomes and syllabus guides. The learning outcomes should be Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, and Time-framed (SMART).

Here are the steps to change your program learning outcomes:

1. Review the current learning outcomes and ensure they are SMART.
2. Identify any areas that need improvement or updating.
3. Consult with stakeholders, such as university administration, faculty, students, alumni, and community members, to ensure agreement on the updated learning outcomes.
4. Modify the learning outcomes to make them realistic and time-framed.
5. Ensure the learning outcomes align with the Carolina Core learning outcomes and the module learning objectives.
6. Create measurable and clear module learning objectives that describe the specific skills students should learn within the module.
7. Use action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy to write the learning objectives.
8. Ensure the instructional materials, assessments, and activities align with and contribute to the achievement of learning outcomes and Objectives.

Remember to adapt the Carolina Core learning outcomes for your program, even if they are not measurable or clear. If the learning outcomes for your program are not measurable, be sure to create measurable and clear module learning objectives.

For additional resources on writing learning outcomes and module learning objectives, refer to the University of South Carolina's CTE website. They provide useful guides and templates to help you get started."

"If my program has multiple concentrations,will a change to the program affect all of the concentrations?","Concentrations are specific areas of study within the major. Anything outside of a concentration is part of the base program. If the change is to the Carolina Core,College Requirements,Program Requirements,or Major requirements (outside of the concentration),then the change will affect all concentrations. If the change is within a specific concentration itself,then it will not affect other concentrations in the program.","
In response to your question, while the University of South Carolina (USC) offers various concentrations within its programs, and a change to one concentration may not necessarily impact all other concentrations. The impact would depend on the specific changes made to the program and the requirements for each concentration. In general, students are encouraged to consult their academic advisors or program-specific course catalog to understand how these changes could affect their chosen concentration.

It is important for students to stay informed about any adjustments to their program and consult with their academic advisors to ensure they make choices aligned with their educational and career goals. Additionally, students should review the revisions to the program structure and curriculum to determine if there are any prerequisites or restrictions affecting their progress towards their degree.

To summarize, a change to one concentration at USC might have varying effects on other concentrations, depending on the specific modifications. Students must remain proactive in staying informed and seeking guidance from academic advisors to guarantee their decisions align with their aspirations and address any program prerequisites or limitations."

However, generally speaking, a student needs to complete high school diploma or its equivalent and meet minimum GPA and SAT/ACT scores as per Gold standard set by the admissions committee.


Additionally, USC also considers other factors such as extracurricular activities, leadership roles, community service, and personal statement while evaluating the application. It is important to note that these additional factors may vary depending upon the program to which the applicant is applying. For example, some programs may require an interview or audition as part of the admission process. Similarly, certain programs may have higher GPA and test score requirements than others.

It is also worth noting that USC has need-blind admission policy, meaning that financial circumstances are not considered during the admission process. This implies that all applicants are evaluated solely based on their academic achievements and potential, irrespective of their financial status. However, students who require financial aid can still apply for need-based scholarships and grants offered by the university.

In light of above mentioned points, I would suggest visiting the official USC website or contacting the admissions office directly to get the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the specific progression requirements for different undergraduate programs at the University of South Carolina."

All new academic programs and program name changes across the entire USC system must be approved by the University Board of Trustees."" CHE approval is required in the following cases: New degree programs; New academic certificates of any length in a new CIP code; New academic certificates of more than 18 credit hours in a current CIP code; Program revisions of more than 18 credit hours including the addition of one or more program concentrations and CIP code changes; Program revisions of delivery location to off-campus (50% or more of credit hours); Extension of an approved health professions program to additional sites in-state,and Center and institute proposals requesting new or additional state funding.

Answer: Based on the provided context, there is no mention of any external approvals being required for your proposal. However, it's essential to follow the internal approval process at the University of South Carolina, ensuring all necessary departmental or college approvals are obtained before submitting the proposal to the Sponsored Awards Management (SAM) office for final institutional approval. Remember to allocate sufficient time for the SAM administrator to review the proposal and provide adequate review and lead time for electronic submissions."
What does each drop/add/w date mean? Will I still get money back for dropped classes?,"The last day of drop/add is the last day you can drop a class without being assigned a W. While a W doesn't affect your GPA,financial aid and academic progression standards require that you earn a certain number of hours each year. After the W date,you'll earn an F for each course you drop. Talk with your adviser and financial aid counselor before you make changes to your schedule. Refunds are pro-rated according to the Registrar's schedule.","
Each drop/Add period begins during the official first day of class for each course, and extends to a minimum of 6% of the Part of Term1in which the course is scheduled. This means that for each course, students can drop classes during the Drop/Add Period without affecting their tuition and fee charges. Additionally, students can add classes during this period without additional charges. After the Drop/Add Period, there will be a refund period during which students may receive a refund for dropped classes, depending on the date of withdrawal. Specifically, for each course, students will receive a refund according to the following schedule:

* During the first five days of classes, students will receive 100% refund
* From the sixth through tenth day, students will receive 50% refund
* From the eleventh through the fifteenth day, students will receive 25% refund
* After the fifteenth day, there will be no refund for dropped classes.

Therefore, if a student drops a course during the Drop/Add Period, they will not receive any refund for that class. However, if they drop the course after the Drop/Add Period, they may receive a refund according to the above schedule. It is important to note that the Drop/Add Period and refund period are separate. That is, even if a student drops a course during the Drop/Add Period, they will not receive any refund for that class. But if they drop the course after the Drop/Add Period but before the refund period begins, they may receive a refund.

In summary, during the Drop/Add Period, students can drop and add classes without affecting their tuition and fee charges. After the Drop/Add Period, there will be a refund period during which students may receive a refund for dropped classes, according to the above schedule. Specifically, for each course, students will receive a refund according to the following schedule: during the first five days of classes, students  will  receive  100%  refund,  from  the sixth  through  tenth  day,  students  will receive 50%  refund,  from  the eleventh  through  the fifteenth day, students  will receive 25% refund,  and  after  the  fifteenth  day,  there  will  be  no refund  for  dropped  classes.  Therefore,  if  a  student  drops "
