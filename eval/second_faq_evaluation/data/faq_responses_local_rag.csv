Can a program include more than one concentration?,"Yes,programs may have multiple concentrations within the major.","I apologize, but I don't have any relevant information to answer your question. Please try asking something about USC."
Can I choose specific (prescribed) courses as part of the Carolina Core for my program?,Yes. Certain programs may require courses that are approved as Carolina Core foundational courses. It makes sense that those programs would “prescribe” those courses as required for the particular Carolina Core component that they fulfill.,"Yes, you can choose specific prescribed courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program. The Carolina Core has 10 components, each with learning outcome and credit hour requirements. Some programs may have a higher number of minimum Carolina Core hours due to specified requirements. Additionally, honors students have access to additional honors courses that may satisfy Carolina Core requirements. You should consult with your academic advisor to determine the best courses for your specific program."
Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Getting approval for distributed learning for one cross-listed course does not automatically approve cross listed courses for distributed learning delivery. Separate submissions are required for each course. (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf),"I apologize, but I don't have enough confident information to provide a good answer to your question. Please try rephrasing or asking about a different topic related to USC."
Do prerequisites have to be enforced in Banner?,"Prerequisites do not have to be enforced in Banner. However,it is recommended that they be enforced,as they are published in the Bulletin. It creates inconsistency in University sources to list prerequisites on the Bulletin,but then not enforce them in Banner.","I apologize, but I don't have any relevant information to answer your question. Please try asking something about USC."
How do Carolina Core Overlay courses work?,"Carolina Core overlay courses meet two Carolina Core learning outcomes in one course. Students may apply a maximum of two overlay courses to their Carolina Core hours. All students must have a minimum of 31 hours of Carolina Core. For a list of overlay-eligible courses,visit the Carolina Core website and sort by the Overlay column in the table. Learn more with the Carolina Core Overlay Training Module (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/courses/foundational-courses.php,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Bed1TZJfbhs&feature=youtu.be&t=2m55s)","Carolina Core Overlay courses offer students the option of meeting two Carolina Core components in a single course. A maximum of two overlays is allowed. The total Carolina Core credit hours must add up to a minimum of 31 hours. This means that if you take an overlay course, it will satisfy two learning outcomes instead of just one, helping you save time and potentially combine similar subjects. Keep in mind that not all courses have overlay options, so check the course catalog or consult with your academic advisor to find out which courses offer overlays."
How do I change my program learning outcomes?,Learning Outcomes are placed in the Academic Assessment Plan Composer . Please contact La Trice Ratcliff-Small in OIRAA with any questions regarding learning outcomes. (http://assessmentplan.ipr.sc.edu/),"To change your program learning outcomes, follow these steps:
1. Review the current learning outcomes and identify areas for improvement or modification.
2. Consult with faculty, staff, and students in your department to gather input and ensure consensus on the changes.
3. Draft revised learning outcomes, making sure they are specific, measurable, agreed upon, realistic, and time-framed (SMART).
4. Submit the proposed changes to the appropriate department chair, dean, or committee for approval.
5. Once approved, update the program's assessment plan, curriculum map, and any relevant documents to reflect the new learning outcomes.
6. Communicate the changes to current and prospective students, as well as any accreditation bodies or external stakeholders as needed.

Remember that changing learning outcomes is a collaborative and iterative process involving multiple stakeholders. Always keep the best interests of your students in mind and strive for continuous improvement in your program."
How do I know if I need a curriculum change proposal to make a change in the Bulletin?,"A curriculum change proposal is required when substantive changes are needed. Changes that are non-substantive include typos,grammar errors,formatting changes,and other changes that do not affect the meaning or interpretation of curricular information.","You need to create a curriculum change proposal if you want to modify any aspect of a course or curriculum, such as course number, title, catalog description, pre/corequisites, delivery method, or cross-listing in the Bulletin. This ensures that the change goes through the proper faculty governance and receives the necessary approvals. More detailed information can be found in ACAF 2.03 Creation and Revision of Academic Courses and the Curriculum Management resource provided by the University of South Carolina."

What are critical courses on the major maps?,"Courses may be marked as critical if there is a deadline for completion or if they may cause a delay in graduation because they serve as a prerequisite in a series of courses,have prescribed sequencing,or have limited offerings. There is a description of why courses are critical for a particular program in the first program note on the back of each major map. Critical courses are explained with examples in the Major Maps Training Module . (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iJrJTDzKCQ&feature=youtu.be)","Critical courses on the major maps refer to essential courses within a specific program of study. These courses are typically required or highly recommended as they contribute significantly to the student's understanding and mastery of the subject matter. They often form the foundation or core curriculum of the major and may include prerequisites, capstone projects, or specialized electives. It is important to consult the academic advisor and the specific major map for detailed information on these critical courses."
What are major maps?,"A major map is a layout of required courses in a given program of study,including critical courses and suggested course sequence to ensure a clear path to graduation. Major maps include universal terminology,a standard program of study,and a common 8-semester template. Access the Major Map Repository Learn more about major maps with the Major Map Training Module (/about/offices_and_divisions/advising/advisor_toolbox/majormaps.php,/about/offices_and_divisions/advising/advisor_training/training-index.php)","Major maps are layouts of required courses in a given program of study, including critical courses and suggested course sequences to ensure a clear path to graduation. However, they should not be considered as strictly binding schedules; students should consult with their academic advisors regarding the best sequence of courses for them."
What are the requirements for a cross-listed course?,"“A cross-listed course is a course that is offered under more than one course subject and is not appropriate for courses with the same course subject. Once a cross-listed course is approved,the courses are viewed as equivalent and identical and should ideally be able to be taken interchangeably within degree programs which require the course.” (ACAF 2.03) Cross-listed courses must have the exact same criteria as listed below: Course Number (if possible; at minimum the course numbers for the cross-listed courses must have be at the same level,i.e.,lower division,upper division,mixed,graduate) Title Course Description Pre-requisites and Co-requisites Catalog Restrictions (e.g.,by student level or program) Carolina Core or GLD designations (if applicable) Grade Mode (i.e.,letter grade or pass/fail) Schedule Type (e.g.,lecture,lab,seminar) a. Cross-listed courses may have different course delivery and location.","Cross-listed courses at the University of South Carolina require permission from the instructor before enrollment. They typically combine content from multiple disciplines into one course. For example, LAWS 804 is cross-listed with ENVR 835, meaning it covers both law and environmental topics. Other cross-listed courses might include GEOL 560, which combines geology and environmental resource management, or PHIL 835, which connects philosophy with environmental ethics.

To enroll in a cross-listed course, contact the instructor offering the course and request permission to register. Keep in mind that some cross-listed courses have specific prerequisites that you must meet before enrolling. These prerequisites are usually outlined in the University's academic bulletin or on the course registration page. Make sure to review these requirements carefully when considering a cross-listed course."
What are the requirements for a syllabus?,"All undergraduate and graduate courses must have a course syllabus that includes the following: Course title (including course subject designator and number) Instructor name and relevant contact information Final Exam day and time,as appropriate (from Office of the Registrar’s website) Class meeting days,times,and location,or equivalent Undergraduate or Graduate Bulletin course description Course learning outcomes Required text(s) and/or suggested readings,as appropriate Course requirements and grading Assignments,projects,quizzes,and/or exams with brief descriptions of expectations with points/weights assigned to each activity.

What is a cognate?,"""A cognate is series of courses that display a distinct curricular pattern in one or more disciplines different from the major. Undergraduate cognates require a minimum of 12 credit hours in advanced level courses related to,but outside the major. Graduate cognates range between 9 and 18 credit hours. Cognates are variable according to what is appropriate as determined by the student and the major advisor. Thus,cognates are not subject to faculty governance review,and do not appear on either the transcripts or the diplomas."" (ACAF 2.00)","I apologize, but I don't have any relevant information to answer your question. Please try asking something about USC."
What is a concentration?,"""A Concentration is a series of courses that display a distinct curricular pattern within the major. They are often called options,emphases,tracks,areas,fields,or specializations. These are different from minors or cognates which are typically outside of the major. Concentrations are subject to faculty governance review,and appear on the transcripts but not the diplomas."" (ACAF 2.00)","In the given context, a concentration refers to a specialized area of focus within a degree program. Students can choose a particular concentration to tailor their studies towards their academic interests or career goals.

"When do cross-listed courses require additional proposals,and not just letters of concurrence?","Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Anytime a course is being deleted. If multiple cross-listed courses are being deleted,separate proposals are needed. Anytime a new course is being created. If a new course is to be cross listed with another new course,two proposals are needed (one for each course). If a new course is going to be cross listed with an existing course,only one proposal is needed. The proposal that creates the new course can also create the cross list,but does need a letter of concurrency. (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf)","Cross-listed courses typically require additional proposals when they involve a significant change in course description, Carolina Core or GLD designation, or delivery mode to more than 50% online. In these cases, a full syllabus must be submitted along with the proposal. However, if the cross-listing only requires a letter of concurrence from the other department, then no additional proposal is needed. It's important to ensure that the course title, meeting days and times, instructor name, and bulletin description all match in both proposals. Additionally, pre-/co-requisites must be consistent across both versions of the course. For special topics and independent studies, which can be variable credit and taken multiple times, the proposal should include the range of hours, number of times the course can be taken for credit, and the maximum number of credit hours that can be applied to the degree. Cross-listed courses should also have clear learning outcomes, appropriate policy statements, and evaluation methods outlined in their respective syllabi."
When is a syllabus required for a proposal?,"Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: A syllabus should only be included in a proposal when necessary. When a syllabus is included,it will be reviewed by the Committee on Curricula and Courses. Proposals that require a syllabus: New course Significant change in the course description,and/or title When required by other committees (i.e.,Carolina Core and Instructional Development -INDEV) Proposals that do not require a syllabus: Minor revisions to the course description or course title (e.g.,slight rephrasing to replace terms as dictated by professional organizations often related to accreditation) Change in co-requisites or pre-requisites Change in course level,as long as not changing to/from 500 or 600. Change in Catalog Restrictions Change in Carolina Core or GLD designations Change in Grade Mode (not needed for removing pass/fail; needed if adding pass/fail) Change in Schedule Type (e.g.,adding/changing lecture/lab/practicum format] Deleting a course (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf)","A syllabus is required for every proposal.

Why do Faculty need to know about DegreeWorks?,"Every undergraduate student has access to his/her personal degree audit. This in important because students monitor their own progress. Degree audits are especially important for athletes,veterans,and OSP (Opportunity Scholars Program) students,who must have an accurate degree audit for compliance (NCAA,GI Bill,Federal Funding). Faculty need to be aware of this because curricular decisions must be accurately reflected in DegreeWorks.","Faculty should be aware of DegreeWorks because it is a web-based tool that students and advisors use to monitor progress toward degree completion and choose appropriate courses to fulfill degree requirements. By understanding how DegreeWorks works, faculty members can better support students in their academic journey, ensure that courses are applied correctly to degree programs, and help plan for future course offerings. Furthermore, faculty can encourage students to utilize this resource for self-guided academic planning and success."
Will my proposal require a letter of concurrence?,"Under ACAF 2.00: Interdisciplinary or Interprofessional Programs : Each instance in which an interdisciplinary or interprofessional program is created,revised,or terminated requires letters of concurrence from all related academic units.

Will my proposal require any external approvals?,"Only programs require external approvals (the President,Board of Trustees (BoT),SACS,and CHE notification or approval),as outline in ACAF 2.00: ""All new academic programs and program name changes across the entire USC system must be approved by the president. All new academic programs and program name changes across the entire USC system must be approved by the University Board of Trustees."" CHE approval is required in the following cases: New degree programs; New academic certificates of any length in a new CIP code; New academic certificates of more than 18 credit hours in a current CIP code; Program revisions of more than 18 credit hours including the addition of one or more program concentrations and CIP code changes; Program revisions of delivery location to off-campus (50% or more of credit hours); Extension of an approved health professions program to additional sites in-state,and Center and institute proposals requesting new or additional state funding.

What does each drop/add/w date mean? Will I still get money back for dropped classes?,"The last day of drop/add is the last day you can drop a class without being assigned a W. While a W doesn't affect your GPA,financial aid and academic progression standards require that you earn a certain number of hours each year. After the W date,you'll earn an F for each course you drop. Talk with your adviser and financial aid counselor before you make changes to your schedule. Refunds are pro-rated according to the Registrar's schedule.","The drop/add/w dates mentioned in the context refer to specific deadlines related to course changes and grades. Here's what they mean:

1. **Last day to change/drop a course without a grade of ""W"" being recorded**: This is the deadline to drop a course without having a ""Withdrawal"" (W) notation on your transcript. Essentially, you can drop the course as if it never happened.

2. **Last day to drop a course or withdraw without a grade of ""WF"" being recorded**: This is the deadline to drop a course and receive a ""Withdrawal"" (W) grade instead of a ""Withdrawal Failing"" (WF) grade. While a W grade does not affect your GPA, a WF grade is equivalent to an ""F"" grade and impacts your GPA negatively.

3. **First day ""W"" grade assigned**: This is the date from which onward, dropping a course will result in a ""Withdrawal"" (W) grade on your transcript.

4. **First day ""WF"" grade assigned**: This is the date from which onward, dropping a course will result in a ""Withdrawal Failing"" (WF) grade on your transcript.

Regarding getting money back for dropped classes, it depends on the timing of the drop. Generally, if you drop a class before the payment deadline, you will receive a full refund. However, once the payment deadline passes, refunds are typically prorated based on the time remaining in the semester. Keep in mind that there might be different refund rules for each part of term, so it's essential to check the specific refund dates related to the part of term your course falls under."
What if I fail a class?,"You may be able to apply for grade forgiveness,which allows an eligible student to take a course a second time for the purpose of earning a higher grade. Grade forgiveness can only be applied once per course for a maximum of two courses,so use it wisely.","I apologize, but I don't have enough confident information to provide a good answer to your question.

What do I do if I can't get into a class I need?,"Keep checking Self-Service Carolina to see if a spot opens up,or ask your professor about an override.","If you are unable to get into a class you need due to a full capacity or a prerequisite requirement, here are some steps you can follow:

1. **Prerequisites**: If you have taken an AP or IB class, or are waiting for a class to transfer from another institution that satisfies a prerequisite for a class at the University of South Carolina, you may need to complete a prerequisite waiver. Reach out to the academic department that sponsors the class you need a prerequisite override for.

2. **Class Overrides**: If the class is full, you might still be able to get in through an override. The process varies depending on the department offering the class. For example, if it is a Computer Science and Engineering (CSEC) class, you would need to fill out their request for prerequisite waiver form and inform them about your situation. They cannot guarantee an override, but they can track the concern. For Math overrides, visit the Math Department website and follow their specific procedure. For Business School overrides, check their Registration FAQs, and for Electrical overrides, use the CEC Waiting List Request Form.

3. **Waitlist**: If the class has a waitlist, ensure you are on it. Sometimes, seats open up as the semester progresses.

4. **Speak with Advisor**: Consult with your academic advisor. They might provide additional guidance or alternatives to help you meet your requirements.

Remember, these steps may not guarantee entry into the desired class, but they offer potential paths forward. It is essential to plan ahead, especially when dealing with overrides and waitlists, since these processes can take time. Good luck!"
