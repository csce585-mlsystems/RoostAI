Carolina Core Overlay courses offer students the option of meeting two Carolina Core components in a single course. A maximum of two overlays is allowed. The total Carolina Core credit hours must add up to a minimum of 31 hours. This means that if you take an overlay course, it will satisfy two learning outcomes instead of just one, helping you save time and potentially combine similar subjects. Keep in mind that not all courses have overlay options, so check the course catalog or consult with your academic advisor to find out which courses offer overlays.

To change your program learning outcomes, follow these steps:
1. Review the current learning outcomes and identify areas for improvement or modification.
2. Consult with faculty, staff, and students in your department to gather input and ensure consensus on the changes.
3. Draft revised learning outcomes, making sure they are specific, measurable, agreed upon, realistic, and time-framed (SMART).
4. Submit the proposed changes to the appropriate department chair, dean, or committee for approval.
5. Once approved, update the program's assessment plan, curriculum map, and any relevant documents to reflect the new learning outcomes.
6. Communicate the changes to current and prospective students, as well as any accreditation bodies or external stakeholders as needed.

Remember that changing learning outcomes is a collaborative and iterative process involving multiple stakeholders. Always keep the best interests of your students in mind and strive for continuous improvement in your program.

To propose a program action at the University of South Carolina, you can follow these steps depending on the type of action you want to take:

1. **Course Actions**: Course development consists of the creation and revision of curricula. For new courses, you need approval by the Unit Head, College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses, and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. You can submit proposals for new courses or changes to existing courses in APPS. The C & C committee, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council may request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns.

2. **Program Termination**: If you want to terminate a program, the proposing department or unit must submit a memo to the Provost, from the Dean of the proposing college, requesting that the program termination be placed on the agenda for consideration at the Board of Trustees meeting. The memo should address the reasons for termination, when and how faculty and students were notified, when the program will cease admitting students, provisions for existing students to complete the degree, effects on faculty, and the last student graduation date. Approval levels include Academic Unit Head, College/School Representative, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council, Board of Trustees (BOT AESEC and Full BOT), CHE Notification, and SACSCOC Notification. Approval levels may take up to one year for full review, and program terminations may only be implemented after CHE and SACSCOC approvals or acknowledgements have been received by the Provost's Office.

3. **CIP Code Changes**: All new programs are assigned a Classification of Instructional Program (CIP) code by the Commission on Higher Education (CHE). CIP Code changes require approval at all levels of the university as well as the state Commission on Higher Education (CHE). CIP changes may only be implemented after CHE approvals have been received by the Provost's Office.

4. **Dual or Joint Degree Programs**: New Dual/Joint degree programs require approval at all levels of the university as well as notification to the Commission on Higher Education (CHE) and Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC). Contracts over $250,000

Cross-listed courses at the University of South Carolina require permission from the instructor before enrollment. They typically combine content from multiple disciplines into one course. For example, LAWS 804 is cross-listed with ENVR 835, meaning it covers both law and environmental topics. Other cross-listed courses might include GEOL 560, which combines geology and environmental resource management, or PHIL 835, which connects philosophy with environmental ethics.

To enroll in a cross-listed course, contact the instructor offering the course and request permission to register. Keep in mind that some cross-listed courses have specific prerequisites that you must meet before enrolling. These prerequisites are usually outlined in the University's academic bulletin or on the course registration page. Make sure to review these requirements carefully when considering a cross-listed course.

Course actions at the University of South Carolina involve creating new courses or revising/eliminating existing ones. New courses require approval from the Unit Head, College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses Committee, and Faculty Senate (or Graduate Council for graduate-level courses). Existing courses can be revised or eliminated with similar approvals. The process typically involves submitting proposals through the APPS system, which may lead to requests for program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns. For Carolina Core courses, specific learning outcomes must be met, and departments must designate at least one upper-level major course that incorporates those outcomes. Integrative Course Proposals should include an explanation of how the course meets the specified Carolina Core Learning Outcomes.

At the University of South Carolina, there are various types of program actions, including Academic Program Development, Course Development, and other Program Actions like CIP Code Changes and Dual or Joint Degree Programs. Each type of program action follows a specific approval process involving different levels of the university and external Agencies such as the Commission on Higher Education (CHE) and Southern Association of Colleges and Schools/Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC).

For Academic Program Development, the process typically involves the following steps:

1. Idea Generation: Identify the need for a new program or a modification of an existing one.
2. Feasibility Study: Conduct a feasibility study to determine the demand, resources, and potential impact of the proposed program.
3. Proposal Development: Develop a detailed proposal outlining the program's goals, objectives, curriculum, resources, and assessment methods.
4. Internal Approval: Submit the proposal through the APPS system for reviews and approvals by the Academic Unit Head, College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses Committee, and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council.
5. External Approval: Once internal approvals are obtained, seek approval from CHE and SACSCOC, if necessary.
6. Implementation: After receiving all required approvals, implement the new or modified program.

For Course Development, the process generally includes the following steps:

1. Propose a new course or propose changes to an existing course via the APPS system.
2. Obtain approval from the Unit Head, Office of Distributed Learning (if adding DL delivery), College/School Representative, Carolina Core Committee (if changing a Carolina Core course), and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council.
3. Implement the approved changes to the course.

Other Program Actions, such as CIP Code Changes and Dual or Joint Degree Programs, have unique approval processes as described in the context provided.

Cross-listed courses typically require additional proposals when they involve a significant change in course description, Carolina Core or GLD designation, or delivery mode to more than 50% online. In these cases, a full syllabus must be submitted along with the proposal. However, if the cross-listing only requires a letter of concurrence from the other department, then no additional proposal is needed. It's important to ensure that the course title, meeting days and times, instructor name, and bulletin description all match in both proposals. Additionally, pre-/co-requisites must be consistent across both versions of the course. For special topics and independent studies, which can be variable credit and taken multiple times, the proposal should include the range of hours, number of times the course can be taken for credit, and the maximum number of credit hours that can be applied to the degree. Cross-listed courses should also have clear learning outcomes, appropriate policy statements, and evaluation methods outlined in their respective syllabi.

A syllabus is required for every proposal. This includes new course proposals, course change proposals, and graduate curricular program and program change proposals. The syllabus must meet certain requirements, such as including specific academic requirements and a method of evaluation for the final letter grade. It should also specify the number of meeting days and times for each credit offered. If the course is a special topics course, the syllabus should indicate how the requirements are quantitatively and qualitatively different for undergraduate and graduate credit.

The drop/add/w dates mentioned in the context refer to specific deadlines related to course changes and grades. Here's what they mean:

1. **Last day to change/drop a course without a grade of "W" being recorded**: This is the deadline to drop a course without having a "Withdrawal" (W) notation on your transcript. Essentially, you can drop the course as if it never happened.

2. **Last day to drop a course or withdraw without a grade of "WF" being recorded**: This is the deadline to drop a course and receive a "Withdrawal" (W) grade instead of a "Withdrawal Failing" (WF) grade. While a W grade does not affect your GPA, a WF grade is equivalent to an "F" grade and impacts your GPA negatively.

3. **First day "W" grade assigned**: This is the date from which onward, dropping a course will result in a "Withdrawal" (W) grade on your transcript.

4. **First day "WF" grade assigned**: This is the date from which onward, dropping a course will result in a "Withdrawal Failing" (WF) grade on your transcript.

Regarding getting money back for dropped classes, it depends on the timing of the drop. Generally, if you drop a class before the payment deadline, you will receive a full refund. However, once the payment deadline passes, refunds are typically prorated based on the time remaining in the semester. Keep in mind that there might be different refund rules for each part of term, so it's essential to check the specific refund dates related to the part of term your course falls under.

If you are unable to get into a class you need due to a full capacity or a prerequisite requirement, here are some steps you can follow:

1. **Prerequisites**: If you have taken an AP or IB class, or are waiting for a class to transfer from another institution that satisfies a prerequisite for a class at the University of South Carolina, you may need to complete a prerequisite waiver. Reach out to the academic department that sponsors the class you need a prerequisite override for.

2. **Class Overrides**: If the class is full, you might still be able to get in through an override. The process varies depending on the department offering the class. For example, if it is a Computer Science and Engineering (CSEC) class, you would need to fill out their request for prerequisite waiver form and inform them about your situation. They cannot guarantee an override, but they can track the concern. For Math overrides, visit the Math Department website and follow their specific procedure. For Business School overrides, check their Registration FAQs, and for Electrical overrides, use the CEC Waiting List Request Form.

3. **Waitlist**: If the class has a waitlist, ensure you are on it. Sometimes, seats open up as the semester progresses.

4. **Speak with Advisor**: Consult with your academic advisor. They might provide additional guidance or alternatives to help you meet your requirements.

Remember, these steps may not guarantee entry into the desired class, but they offer potential paths forward. It is essential to plan ahead, especially when dealing with overrides and waitlists, since these processes can take time. Good luck!
