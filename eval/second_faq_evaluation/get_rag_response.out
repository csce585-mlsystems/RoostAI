Response: Carolina Core Overlay courses allow students to apply the methods of one learning outcome from a Carolina Core course to another Carolina Core course in a different discipline. This way, students can deepen their understanding of a particular concept by seeing it from multiple perspectives. When choosing an overlay course, consider selecting one that naturally aligns with the learning outcome you want to reinforce. It is important to note that no more than two overlays are allowed, and they should be chosen carefully to maximize the benefits of interdisciplinary learning. Also, keep in mind that the total Carolina Core credit hours must add up to a minimum of 31 hours.

Response: The requirements for a syllabus generally include providing essential information about the course such as the course title, course number, semester/year, class location, instructor's name, office location, office hours, e-mail address, office phone number, and TA information (if needed). Furthermore, the course description, goals, and learning outcomes should be specified. The goals and learning outcomes should be SMART, meaning specific, measurable, agreed upon, realistic, and time-framed. At least three to five learning outcomes should be listed, including at least one from a given list by the DPA committee. Additionally, the overall structure of the course, course requirements, and course policies need to be outlined. These sections detail what students will have to do in the course, including assignments, exams, projects, and performances. The nature and format of these assignments should be described. Expectations and procedures concerning attendance, tardiness, class participation, missed exams or assignments, accommodation for disabilities or special needs, and academic honesty should be stated. Lastly, assessment and grading procedures should align with the learning outcomes and should include various methods of evaluation.

Response: An integrative course is a type of course that combines both theoretical instruction and practical application. It goes beyond traditional lectures by engaging students in discussions, reflections, and exercises that prompt them to integrate their knowledge into real-world scenarios. This approach not only deepens their understanding of the material but also prepares them for future applications of their learning. The goal of an integrative course is to create a holistic learning environment where students can engage in activities beyond the classroom and make connections between these experiences. It is designed to bring together faculty, instructors, and graduate students interested in exploring ways to help students reflect on and connect what they do within and beyond their curriculum, embrace multiple perspectives, and synthesize and transfer their knowledge to new, complex situations. The objective is to obtain a deeper understanding of the ideals of integrative and experiential learning and develop a toolbox of simple techniques to engage students in reflection on their experiences within and beyond the classroom.

Response: An undergraduate degree program typically consists of a series of courses that students take to earn their bachelor's degree. At the University of South Carolina's College of Education, students can choose from various undergraduate programs with different credit hour requirements and course selection guidelines. For example, to earn a Bachelor of Arts or Science and a Master of Teaching degree, students must maintain a minimum overall GPA of 2.75, complete an undergraduate major based on their desired teaching subject, and take a mix of education and subject-specific courses. Additionally, students may need to complete certain prerequisites or additional courses depending on their chosen undergraduate program and content teaching area. It's essential for students to consult with their advisors to ensure they meet all requirements before registering for courses.

In summary, an undergraduate degree program involves completing specific coursework and meeting particular requirements to earn a bachelor's degree. Students should work closely with their advisors to ensure they fulfill all necessary criteria for their chosen program.

Response: The process for course actions at the University of South Carolina involves creating new courses or revising existing ones. This requires approval by the department head and college representative, followed by submission through APPS (the online system used for course Actions Office). The proposal or change request must include justification and be approved by the college representative, Faculty Senate, or Graduate Council. Once approved, the Integrative Course designation can be added, which ensures awareness and attention to foundational skills woven throughout the curriculum. The unit head has regulatory oversight over these courses. However, the ultimate authority lies with the faculty senate, which can approve or reject proposals to create, revise, or terminate courses. Proposals for course changes are submitted in APPS. If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, it requires approval from the Unit Head, College Representative, Curricula and Courses Committee, or Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Similarly, if changing an existing course, it must be approved by the Unit Head, College/School Representative, Curricula, the question of how the process for course actions does not seem to have any relevance to the context of the Provost to ensure that all readings meet the academic expectation of the University.

2024-11-30 22:12:39,346 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: The process for program actions involves submitting a new course proposal or course change proposal in APPS with the Carolina Core information completed. If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, a course change proposal must be submitted in APPS with the Carolina Core information. In the justification section, the following information should be provided: Carolina Core Integrative Course, Major Name, Degree (e.g., ANTH 444, Anthropology, B.S.’) and explain how the Carolina Core Learning Outcomes are integrated into higher level classes in the major. The reason for this is that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course from the Carolina Core.

2024-11-30 22:13:05,757 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: When proposing a Special Topics Education course, a syllabus is indeed required for approval. This document should address the specific topic of interest to educators and include academic requirements along with a clear method of evaluation for the final letter grade. It should also specify a minimum of 700 minutes of instruction over one week of study for each credit offered (i.e. a 3-credit course must include a minimum of 2100 minutes of instruction over 3 weeks). However, once the course is finalized and ready to be offered, it should be submitted to the Department Chair for review and approval. This does not imply that the syllabus should not include a normal face-to-face or online class or module for review.

Response: It's important to note that the decision of whether a budget is needed depends on the type of project you're proposing. For example, a budget isn't needed if the project is community-based and funded through a federal agency. For such projects, a budget is necessary. Additionally, the budget justification should reflect the sources of the funds and the amounts allocated to various categories.

Response: The phrase 'each drop/add/w date' refers to two different dates: the add/drop deadline and the tuition refund deadline. These deadlines may vary by course, so it's essential to check them individually. Generally, dropping a course after the add/drop deadline but before the tuition refund deadline will result in no grade assignment and potential loss of some or all tuition paid for the course. After the tuition refund deadline, no grade will be assigned for the dropped course. Still, a student might be eligible for a partial tuition refund depending on the course and the timing of the drop. The amount refunded varies and is determined by the University Registrar's webpage on withdrawal(https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/registration/withdrawal/index.php), we cannot predict the exact amount of tuition refunded. However, we know that after the tuition refund deadline, no grade will be assigned for the dropped course.

Response: If you fail a class, it means that you did not meet the minimum requirements to pass the course. It could be due to various reasons such as poor attendance, lack of effort, or misunderstanding of course material. However, it is important to remember that failing a class does not necessarily mean that you are not capable or intelligent; it could simply mean that you struggled with the specific course content. In this situation, consider retaking the class, seeking help from the instructor, or utilizing tutoring services. Remember, every setback is an opportunity to learn and grow.

Response: Based on my analysis of the provided context, dual degree graduates are indeed allowed to sit with the college of their choice, subject to certain conditions. Specifically, they must meet the admission requirements of both programs, maintain a GPA of at least 3.00, and complete at least 12 credit hours that count toward both undergraduate and graduate degrees. These conditions ensure that the quality and integrity of each degree involved is maintained. Furthermore, the context suggests that dual degree graduates can apply for dual credit through an Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan, which combines courses from both undergraduate and graduate programs. This plan must be reviewed and approved by the Graduate Council. So, yes, dual degree graduates are allowed to sit with the college of their choice, subject to the aforementioned conditions.
