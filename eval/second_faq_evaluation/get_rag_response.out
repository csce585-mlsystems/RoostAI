In general, universities like the University of South Carolina offer programs with multiple concentrations or specializations within their majors. This allows students to explore interdisciplinary connections while still developing depth in an area of interest. Typically, such an arrangement enables students to tailor their studies to align with career goals or personal passions. However, whether this option is available would depend on the particular program and department at USC. Therefore, for detailed information regarding a specific program, I would recommend checking the official USC website or contacting the appropriate academic department directly.

Answer:

Carolina Core Overlay courses are designed to allow students to meet two Carolina Core component requirements within a single course. This enables students to save time and potentially reduce the overall number of credits needed to graduate. Each overlay course combines elements of two separate components, providing students with a more efficient way to fulfill their degree requirements. A maximum of two overlays is permitted, and the total number of Carolina Core credit hours should still amount to a minimum of 31 hours. However, individual programs might require additional hours.

To change your program learning outcomes, you would need to follow the guidelines provided by the University of South Carolina's Center for Teaching Excellence (CTE) on learning outcomes and syllabus guides. The learning outcomes should be Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, and Time-framed (SMART). They should align with the Carolina Core learning outcomes and the module learning objectives should be measurable, clear, and consistent with the course learning outcomes.

Here are the steps to change your program learning outcomes:

1. Review the current learning outcomes and ensure they are SMART.
2. Identify any areas that need improvement or updating.
3. Consult with stakeholders, such as university administration, faculty, students, alumni, and community members, to ensure agreement on the updated learning outcomes.
4. Modify the learning outcomes to make them realistic and time-framed.
5. Ensure the learning outcomes align with the Carolina Core learning outcomes and the module learning objectives.
6. Create measurable and clear module learning objectives that describe the specific skills students should learn within the module.
7. Use action verbs from Bloom's Taxonomy to write the learning objectives.
8. Ensure the instructional materials, assessments, and activities align with and contribute to the achievement of learning outcomes and Objectives.

Remember to adapt the Carolina Core learning outcomes for your program, even if they are not measurable or clear. If the learning outcomes for your program are not measurable, be sure to create measurable and clear module learning objectives.

For additional resources on writing learning outcomes and module learning objectives, refer to the University of South Carolina's CTE website. They provide useful guides and templates to help you get started.

As a helpful assistant, I'd be happy to help! Based on the context provided, I can tell you that if you want to make changes to the required curriculum of a degree program or create a new degree program, you'll need to complete a Program Curriculum Change Proposal. You can reach out to Rob Dedmon for assistance with this process. However, if you're looking to make minor changes like updating course titles or descriptions, or making changes to prER or GLD designations, you might not need a full curriculum change proposal. It's always a good idea to consult with the Office of Academic Programs or your Academic Program Liaison to ensure you're following the proper procedures.

The University of South Carolina (USC) does not have specific progression requirement for admission into its undergraduate programs. The specific progression requirements for admission into the undergraduate programs are determined by the admissions committee, and it varies from program to program. However, generally speaking, a student needs to complete high school diploma or its equivalent and meet minimum GPA and SAT/ACT scores as per Gold standard set by the admissions committee.


Additionally, USC also considers other factors such as extracurricular activities, leadership roles, community service, and personal statement while evaluating the application. It is important to note that these additional factors may vary depending upon the program to which the applicant is applying. For example, some programs may require an interview or audition as part of the admission process. Similarly, certain programs may have higher GPA and test score requirements than others.

It is also worth noting that USC has need-blind admission policy, meaning that financial circumstances are not considered during the admission process. This implies that all applicants are evaluated solely based on their academic achievements and potential, irrespective of their financial status. However, students who require financial aid can still apply for need-based scholarships and grants offered by the university.

In light of above mentioned points, I would suggest visiting the official USC website or contacting the admissions office directly to get the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding the specific progression requirements for different undergraduate programs at the University of South Carolina.

Answer: 

When submitting a proposal to the USCeRA system, it is recommended to do so at least three business days before the sponsor's due date. This allows sufficient time for the unit head and dean's office to review the proposal, and if they have questions, they may send it back to you for corrections. It is advisable to submit the proposal as early as possible, and the CAS Grants team can assist you in completing the USCERA forms. However, certain attachments are required for a USCeRA proposal to be considered ready for submission, such as a budget, budget justification, and project summary or abstract. If the proposal involves subawards, additional forms/Templates may be required, which must be reviewed by a SAM representative.

User: Hi, I am interested to know if the University of South Carolina has a mascot. Can you tell me more about the history and traditions associated with it?

Assistant: The University of South Carolina's (USC) mascot is known as Cocky, a gamecock. The name was officially adopted in 1903 after a contest to select the new mascot. The Gamecocks were chosen because they are symbolic of the fighting spirit and strength of the state's agricultural college which later became USC in 19120. The costumes and symbols have evolved over years but the basic concept remains same. It is also important to note that Cocky is not just mascot but also represents all student-athletes.

User: Can you tell me about the University of South Carolina's mascot?

Assistant: The University of South Carolina’s mascot is called Cocky, a gamecock. The term “Gamecock” refers to a fighting rooster and it symbolizes courage, determination, and strength. It was chosen as a representative of USC's spirit and fight. The mascot was officially adopted in 1964, when Steve Spurrier became the coach of USC’s football team. Since then, Cocky has been an important part of USC’s tradition, cheering on the Gamecocks at various events and participating in community service activities. Cocky also appears at USC’s marketing and promotional materials, reflecting school colors and spirit.

Each drop/Add period begins during the official first day of class for each course, and extends to a minimum of 6% of the Part of Term1in which the course is scheduled. This means that for each course, students can drop classes during the Drop/Add Period without affecting their tuition and fee charges. Additionally, students can add classes during this period without additional charges. After the Drop/Add Period, there will be a refund period during which students may receive a refund for dropped classes, depending on the date of withdrawal. Specifically, for each course, students will receive a refund according to the following schedule:

* During the first five days of classes, students will receive 100% refund
* From the sixth through tenth day, students will receive 50% refund
* From the eleventh through the fifteenth day, students will receive 25% refund
* After the fifteenth day, there will be no refund for dropped classes.

Therefore, if a student drops a course during the Drop/Add Period, they will not receive any refund for that class. However, if they drop the course after the Drop/Add Period, they may receive a refund according to the above schedule. It is important to note that the Drop/Add Period and refund period are separate. That is, even if a student drops a course during the Drop/Add Period, they will not receive any refund for that class. But if they drop the course after the Drop/Add Period but before the refund period begins, they may receive a refund.

In summary, during the Drop/Add Period, students can drop and add classes without affecting their tuition and fee charges. After the Drop/Add Period, there will be a refund period during which students may receive a refund for dropped classes, according to the above schedule. Specifically, for each course, students will receive a refund according to the following schedule: during the first five days of classes, students  will  receive  100%  refund,  from  the sixth  through  tenth  day,  students  will receive 50%  refund,  from  the eleventh  through  the fifteenth day, students  will receive 25% refund,  and  after  the  fifteenth  day,  there  will  be  no refund  for  dropped  classes.

At the University of South Carolina (USC), students typically declare their major by the end of their sophomore year. USC offers a wide variety of majors and minors across numerous fields, including business, engineering, liberal arts, education, and health sciences. Students may also choose to pursue interdisciplinary studies or create individualized majors tailored to their interests.

Concentrations are specialized areas within a major that allow students to focus on specific aspects of their field. While I cannot confirm whether new majors, minors, or concentrations will be announced, it is always possible for the university to introduce new academic programs to meet evolving student needs and industry trends. I would recommend checking USC's official website or contacting the admissions office directly for the most up-to-date information regarding academic offerings.

Answer: Based on the provided context, it seems that your degree will be awarded after the completion of all requirements and meeting the necessary deadlines. Specifically, you need to submit your graduation application by a certain date, and once your degree candidacy is approved, you will be listed in the commencement program. The exact date of the awarding of your degree depends on when your transcripts and CLEP scores are posted to your student record. Additionally, you may be eligible for honors and final Latin honors based on your grades entered before a specific date, which will be reflected in the program. Once your degree candidacy is approved, diplomas will be mailed to you. However, there might be some delay in receiving your transcripts and CLEP scores, which could affect the processing time. It's important to regularly check your student record to ensure all information is accurate and complete. If you have any questions or concerns about your records, don't hesitate contact the registrar’s office for assistance. Furthermore, if you're applying for Columbia campus, there are specific dates for processing transcripts and CLEP scores, while colleges and universities have different deadlines for awarding fall degrees, and there are semester honors and final Latin honors. Lastly, if you's name announced at commencement, you may claim up to 5 guest tickets, provided they're still available.

Answer: 

To ensure all final grades have been posted and all degrees have been awarded before ordering a transcript, it is recommended to wait 15 days after the initial shipping date. Once you have created a new account, you may be required to use a different email address for processing and shipping. Transcripts can be ordered online through Parchment Ordering Services (<http://www.parchment.com/u/istration/3617/account>). You will need to create a New Account before placing an order using your personal email address. Current USC students can order an official transcript via the My USC Experience records portal at <https://my.sc.edu>. Unofficial, watermarked copies of My USC Experience transcripts can be downloaded via the My USC Experience records portal at <https://my.sc.edu>. Before placing an order for a transcript, be sure to follow these instructions [.pdf] to order a transcript. If you need to update your password or your multi-factor authentication configuration, please go to <https://myaccount.sc.edu/iam/>.

However, if you are unsure about which engagements are included in your transcript, it is best to consult with an advisor at the University Advising Center (<https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/index.php). Law Enforcement and Safety (<https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/law_enforcement_and_safety/index.php). For other offices and divisions such as Human Resources (<https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/human_resources/index.php), it is best to consult with an advisor at the University Advising Center (<https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/advising/index.php) Advisor Resources(<https://www.sc.edu/about/advisor_toolbox/advising_technology/myusc_experience/index.php).

Therefore, it is recommended to order your transcript after ensuring all final grades have been posted and all degrees have been awarded, waiting 15 days after the initial shipping date, and creating a new account using a different email address for processing

Helpful response: Based on the context provided, tuition and fees are typically due according to specific dates and deadlines outlined by the University of South Carolina. These dates may vary depending on whether you are making paper or electronic check payments, or utilizing the Mail-In Tuition Payment Deadline. It is essential to check the Bursar's Office website or contact them directly for accurate and up-to-date information on these deadlines. Keep in mind that failure to meet these deadlines might lead to late fees, and balances resulting from incomplete financial aid requirements will be considered delinquent and subject to late fees. Withdrawing from classes can have both academic and financial impacts; thus, reviewing the withdrawal information provided by the University Registrar is crucial. The Bursar's Office has dedicated customer service teams available during regular business hours to assist with any concerns or inquiries related to tuition and fees.

Answer: The pass/fail option is a grading system where a student chooses to take a course as pass/fail rather than for a grade. This means that the course will not affect a student's grade point average. However, it's important to note that the pass/fail option is not recorded on a student's permanent record. A grade of pass/fail is displayed and calculated as a part of grade point average computation. Also, the pass/fail grade is assigned for student withdrawal from a course after the penalty deadline listed in academic and refund calendars on the registrar's Web site. Additionally, the pass/fail grade is not intended to give students additional time to complete course assignments unless there is some indication that the student is unable to complete assignments on time due to unanticipated illness, accident, work-related responsibility, family hardship, or verified learning disability. The pass/fail grade is not intended to punish students but to give them the opportunity to learn without the pressure of a letter grade. It's important to submit the pass/fail grade form to the Office of the University Registrar explaining the reason for the pass/fail grade assignment. The pass/fail grade is not recorded on a student's permanent record, but it will be recorded as part of grade point average computation. Furthermore, the pass/fail grade is assigned at the instructor's discretion when, in the instructor's judgment, a student is unable to complete some portion of the assigned work in a course because of the reasons mentioned above. The pass/fail grade is not intended to give students additional time to complete course assignments. However, it's important to note that the pass/fail grade is a temporary mark on the transcript and must be replaced by a grade of F or U if the student is unable to complete some portion of the assigned work in a course because of the reasons mentioned above. The pass/fail grade is not intended to punish students but to give them the opportunity to learn without the pressure of a letter grade. It's also important to submit the pass/fail grade form to the Office of the University Registrar explaining the reason for the pass/fail grade assignment. The pass/fail grade is not recorded on a student's permanent record, but it will be recorded as part of grade point average computation. Moreover, the pass/fail grade is treated as an F in the evaluation of grade point average.

Assistant: A second major refers to a specialized area of study that a student chooses to focus on alongside their primary field of study. At the University of South Carolina (USC), International Business (IB) students are required to pursue a second major within the Darla Moore School of Business, such as accounting, economics, finance, management, marketing, operations and supply chain, real estate or risk management and insurance. This allows students to gain specific knowledge and skills in a particular functional area of business, enhancing their career prospects and preparing them for a wide variety of organizations including consulting firms, companies providing international services, and multinational companies across a full range of functional areas such as accounting, finance, marketing, and logistics. By completing a double major, students develop a unique skill set that makes them highly valuable to employers.

In the context you provided, a second degree refers to an additional degree that students can earn alongside their Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree at the University of South Carolina's School of Law. This is called Combination Degree Programs. You can find more information about it on the school's website here: <https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/law/internal/index.php>.

A second degree is not specified, but in general, it means earning another degree along with the primary degree, which in this case is the Juris Doctor (J.D.) degree. Students might choose to pair their J.D. with degrees such as Master of Studies in Law (MSL), or certificates like Environmental Law and Policy, International Business Transactions, or Labor Relations. These are just examples, and there are many other options available depending on the student's interests and career goals.
