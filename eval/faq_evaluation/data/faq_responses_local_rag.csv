Can a program include more than one concentration?,"Yes,programs may have multiple concentrations within the major.","I apologize, but I don't have enough relevant information to provide a good answer."
Can I choose specific (prescribed) courses as part of the Carolina Core for my program?,Yes. Certain programs may require courses that are approved as Carolina Core foundational courses. It makes sense that those programs would “prescribe” those courses as required for the particular Carolina Core component that they fulfill.,"
Answer: Yes, you can choose specific courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program. Each component of the Carolina Core has an associated list of approved courses from which you can select those that best align with your interests and academic goals. Some colleges and programs might also have specific requirements or recommendations for Carolina Core courses. It is essential to work closely with your advisor to make informed decisions regarding your Carolina Core course selection to ensure timely degree completion and alignment with your major."
Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Getting approval for distributed learning for one cross-listed course does not automatically approve cross listed courses for distributed learning delivery. Separate submissions are required for each course. (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf),"I apologize, but I don't have enough relevant information to provide a good answer."
Do prerequisites have to be enforced in Banner?,"Prerequisites do not have to be enforced in Banner. However,it is recommended that they be enforced,as they are published in the Bulletin. It creates inconsistency in University sources to list prerequisites on the Bulletin,but then not enforce them in Banner.","I apologize, but I don't have enough relevant information to provide a good answer."
How do Carolina Core Overlay courses work?,"Carolina Core overlay courses meet two Carolina Core learning outcomes in one course. Students may apply a maximum of two overlay courses to their Carolina Core hours. All students must have a minimum of 31 hours of Carolina Core. For a list of overlay-eligible courses,visit the Carolina Core website and sort by the Overlay column in the table.

How do I change my program learning outcomes?,Learning Outcomes are placed in the Academic Assessment Plan Composer . Please contact La Trice Ratcliff-Small in OIRAA with any questions regarding learning outcomes. (http://assessmentplan.ipr.sc.edu/),"
To change your program learning outcomes, you need to follow the guidelines provided by the University of South Carolina. Since you want to modify Carolina Core courses' learning outcomes, keep in mind that you shouldn't modify them even if they are not measurable or clear. Instead, create measurable and clear module learning objectives that align with the course learning outcomes.

Here are some steps to help you change your program learning outcomes:

1. Review the current program learning outcomes and identify areas that need improvement or modification.
2. Ensure the desired changes are aligned with the university's mission, goals, and learning outcomes.
3. Create new learning outcomes that are Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, and Time-framed (SMART).
4. Write module learning objectives that are measurable, clear, and consistent with the revised course learning outcomes.
5. Update the syllabus, instructional materials, assessments, and activities to align with the new learning outcomes and objectives.
6. Communicate the changes to all stakeholders, including students, faculty, and administration.
7. Seek approval from the necessary university committees or departments following the institution's policies and procedures.

Remember, any changes to program learning outcomes should be done thoughtfully and deliberately, considering the impact on students, faculty, and the overall curriculum. Always ensure the changes align with the university's goals and expectations."
How do I know if I need a curriculum change proposal to make a change in the Bulletin?,"A curriculum change proposal is required when substantive changes are needed. Changes that are non-substantive include typos,grammar errors,formatting changes,and other changes that do not affect the meaning or interpretation of curricular information.","
A curriculum change proposal is typically required when making significant modifications to a degree program or creating a new one. These modifications could include changes to program titles, additions or deletions of programs, options, or concentrations, major curricular changes within programs, or offering existing programs via distance education. When in doubt, it's always better to consult with the appropriate office or individual responsible for managing curriculum changes at the University of South Carolina to ensure compliance with established procedures."

"If my program has multiple concentrations,will a change to the program affect all of the concentrations?","Concentrations are specific areas of study within the major. Anything outside of a concentration is part of the base program. If the change is to the Carolina Core,College Requirements,Program Requirements,or Major requirements (outside of the concentration),then the change will affect all concentrations. If the change is within a specific concentration itself,then it will not affect other concentrations in the program.","I apologize, but I don't have enough relevant information to provide a good answer."
What are critical courses on the major maps?,"Courses may be marked as critical if there is a deadline for completion or if they may cause a delay in graduation because they serve as a prerequisite in a series of courses,have prescribed sequencing,or have limited offerings.

Response: If you are a newly enrolled student and are trying to access library resources before the start of your first semester (which begins in the fall), you may not have online access yet.
