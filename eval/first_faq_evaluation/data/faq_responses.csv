The Carolina Core is designed to be incorporated into any major at USC. This structured approach ensures that undergraduates engage deeply with the core competencies, often through courses or experiences specifically allocated within their major's curriculum. Here's a general example of how it might be structured:

1. **Liberal Arts Integration:** Students within their major must complete specific liberal arts courses (such as writing, analysis, quantitative reasoning or social science foundations) which directly contribute to their understanding of their discipline while developing foundational skills.

2. **Interdisciplinary Learning:** Courses within a major may overlap with other disciplines, fostering a broad context and encouraging the drawing of connections between diverse subjects. Research projects or internships might be required in areas beyond the student's primary focus to broaden their perspective.

3. **Professional Skills:** Alongside these academic learning objectives, students will be encouraged to cultivate professional competencies like leadership, innovation, or ethical decision-making. It might be achieved through workshops, seminars, or capstone projects relevant to their field.

4. **Community Engagement:** Students serve as community partners, assisting with outreach programs, volunteering, or internships. This promotes civic participation and responsibility.
