2024-12-12 03:37:14,187 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: In the specific case of the Ph.D. in Marine Science program at the University of South Carolina, applicants can indeed apply to more than one concentration simultaneously. However, it's essential to note that once admitted into the program, students must choose only one concentration for their studies. This means that while you can express interest in multiple concentrations during the application process, you will eventually need to focus on just one of them for your degree requirements.

Response: Yes, you can choose specific courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program at the University of South Carolina. The Carolina Core consists of required courses with uniform learning outcomes that apply to all students, regardless of their major. While there are certain prescribed courses within each category of the Carolina Core, you have the flexibility to select from a variety of approved options that best align with your interests and academic goals. It's essential to review the list of courses satisfying Carolina Core requirements on the university's website and consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're making the most informed decisions for your educational journey. Keep in mind that courses used to satisfy Carolina Core requirements may not also be used to fulfill minor requirements.

2024-12-12 03:37:21,121 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: When making changes to a cross-listed course, it is essential to consider how these alterations may impact any associated cross-listed courses. However, whether all changes directly affect the cross-listed courses depends on the nature of the modifications. For instance, if there are adjustments to prerequisites, corequisites, or cross-listings themselves, then those changes will undoubtedly influence the connected courses. On the other hand, minor edits to the course description without affecting the course content, learning objectives, or assessment methods might not necessarily impact the cross-listed courses.

In terms of syllabi submission for cross-listed courses, it is required when introducing new courses or significantly changing course descriptions, Carolina Core or GLD designations, or delivery modes to over 50% online. This policy ensures that any substantial modifications undergo thorough examination and approval before implementation.

Lastly, regarding course bulletin descriptions and cross-listing submissions, it is crucial to ensure that all cross-listed courses have been uploaded timely and their bulletin descriptions are identical. This consistency facilitates a smooth review process and helps maintain the integrity of the academic offerings at the University of South Carolina.

2024-12-12 03:37:24,267 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: No, prerequisites do not necessarily have to be enforced in Banner during registration. However, it's essential to ensure that you meet all the prerequisites of the courses you intend to take. This is because Banner may prevent you from registering if you haven't satisfied the necessary prerequisites.

If you find yourself in a situation where you don't meet the prerequisites for a specific course, there might still be an opportunity to request an override. To learn more about overrides and their corresponding forms, consult the appropriate resources provided by the University of South Carolina.

Ultimately, discussing your concerns with your academic advisor is highly recommended. They can assess your situation and guide you through the process of obtaining a prerequisite waiver or override if needed.

Response: Carolina Core Overlay courses are a unique type of course at the University of South Carolina that allows students to fulfill multiple requirements with just one class. These overlays focus on developing essential skills such as public speaking and information literacy, making them particularly valuable for students pursuing various disciplines.

When taking an Overlay course, students have the opportunity to meet two requirements within a single course – but at least one of these overlays must stand alone and not be used to satisfy other parts of the Carolina Core. It's important to consult your specific major checklist or consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're selecting the right Overlay courses to meet your degree requirements.

To give you an idea of what to look for, approved Carolina Core Overlay courses should address specific learning outcomes from the Carolina Core, such as those related to Communication Skills (CMS), Information Literacy (INF), or Values, Ethics, and Social Responsibility (VSR). Additionally, the college or department responsible for offering the course should demonstrate expertise in the content area associated with the learning outcome.

For example, if a student takes HIST 108, it can serve as both a Non-US History course and a VSR overlay, helping them progress toward their graduation goals. By understanding how Carolina Core Overlay courses work, students like you can make informed decisions about which classes will best support your academic success!

Response: To change your program learning outcomes at the University of South Carolina, follow these steps:

1. Log into APPS (Academic Program Planning System) using your USC credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Program Learning Outcomes" section for your specific program.
3. Carefully review the existing learning outcomes, ensuring they remain clear, simple, and measurable.
4. Make necessary adjustments or additions to the learning outcomes, keeping in mind that they should align with your course content and reflect the desired student competencies upon completion of the program.
5. Save your changes and submit them for approval through the appropriate channels within the university. This may involve obtaining approval from department chairs, deans, or other university officials.
6. Keep track of your submitted changes and monitor their progress until they are officially approved and implemented.

Remember that learning outcomes should be reviewed and adjusted periodically as you become more familiar with students' abilities and changing academic expectations. Always strive to create learning outcomes that are relevant, current, and aligned with best practices in higher education.

Response: A curriculum change proposal is typically required when making significant modifications to a course or program of study. However, non-curricular information such as faculty listings, contact information, and college or departmental descriptive text can be updated directly by contacting the Office of the University Registrar. For minor updates or corrections to course descriptions, you might not need a full curriculum change proposal; instead, you could reach out to the appropriate university committee for guidance. If you're unsure whether your intended changes require a curriculum change proposal, it would be best to consult with the Curriculum Committee or an academic advisor at the University of South Carolina.

Response: To propose a program action at the University of South Carolina, you should first familiarize yourself with the goals and objectives of your specific program. Once you have identified an area for improvement or change, consider discussing your ideas with fellow students, faculty advisors, or other relevant stakeholders. This can help refine your proposal and gather support from those directly affected by the proposed action.

Next, draft a clear and concise proposal outlining the issue, your suggested solution, and any anticipated benefits or challenges. Be sure to include any necessary data or research to support your claims. Submit your proposal to the appropriate administrator or committee within your program or department, typically through a designated process or channel.

Keep in mind that successful program actions often involve collaboration, communication, and compromise between various parties. Stay open to feedback and willing to adjust your proposal as needed to ensure its alignment with the overall mission and values of the University of South Carolina.

Response: The time it takes for a proposal to receive all levels of approval can vary but typically may take several months. After submission, the proposal undergoes review by curriculum committees during the second week of each month. Once reviewed, it moves forward for a funding decision which can take six to nine months. Additionally, required approvals as outlined in the guidelines may also contribute to this timeline. Please note that you'll be notified within 10 business days whether or not you have been approved. For specific questions regarding the approval process, feel free to contact Wanda Barr at (803) 777-1875 or wandab@mailbox.sc.edu.

Response: If you are pursuing a degree in Business Administration at USC, changing your concentration will only affect the specific area of study you choose to specialize in. The seven concentration options include Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Real Estate, Supply Chain Management, and Entrepreneurship. Each concentration has its unique course requirements and focuses on different aspects of business administration. However, if you're in the Master of Arts in Teaching program with three concentration options, changing your concentration would alter your entire program's focus. In this case, the three concentrations are Elementary Education, Middle Level Education, or Secondary Education. Please let me know if you need more information about either of these programs!

Response: In this context, critical courses on major maps refer to essential courses within a specific program of study that must be completed as part of the degree requirements. They typically form the foundation of the discipline and provide students with fundamental knowledge and skills necessary for success in their chosen field. Critical courses may vary depending on the major, so it's essential to consult the appropriate major map for detailed information on these courses. Keep in mind that while major maps offer a suggested sequence of courses, consulting an academic advisor can help clarify the application of specific coursework to a program of study and provide guidance on course selection and planning for future semesters.

Response: A major map at the University of South Carolina is a layout of required courses in a specific program of study, outlining critical courses and suggesting course sequences to help ensure a clear path to graduation. These maps serve as a guide for students pursuing their chosen field and are only a suggested or recommended sequence of courses required in the program. It is essential to consult an academic advisor for assistance in applying specific coursework to the program, as well as guidance on course selection and planning for future semesters. Additionally, all changes must be registered with the College Academic Affairs and Advising Office.

Response: A cross-listed course at the University of South Carolina (USC) refers to a single course that is offered by two or more departments with different prefixes but identical content, credit hours, and learning objectives. In this case, the requirements for a cross-listed course will depend on the specific department offering the course as its prerequisites. However, generally, if a student satisfies the prerequisites for one of the cross-listed courses, they are considered to meet the requirements for all other cross-listed versions of that course. For example, if a student meets the prerequisites for HIST 301, they would also satisfy the prerequisites for HUM 301 if it is cross-listed with HIST 301.

Response: At the University of South Carolina - Columbia, there isn't a strict requirement for a syllabus as it may vary depending on the course or instructor. However, a well-constructed syllabus typically outlines what is to be learned, how learning will occur, and how learning will be evaluated. Additionally, you might receive an email with specific details about what should be included in your syllabus. Ultimately, the syllabus serves as a crucial guide for students throughout the course, establishing expectations, standards, and overall structure.

2024-12-12 03:38:11,555 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: A cognate is a cluster of advanced-level courses (typically 12 credits) that relate to your major but aren't directly a part of it. For example, if you're studying Marine Science, Environmental Science, or Environmental Studies, you don't need a cognate. However, if you're studying Geological Sciences, you will need one. A cognate allows you to explore topics related to your major in greater depth, providing an opportunity to tailor your studies to your interests and career goals. It will appear on your academic transcript but not on your diploma. The specific courses that make up your cognate will be determined in consultation with your major advisor.

Response: A concentration is a specialized set of courses within a major field of study, allowing students to focus on specific areas of interest. It provides an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and skills in a particular subject. In the context of the University of South Carolina, concentrations can be added to your degree plan by consulting with your academic advisor. For instance, if you're studying physics and wish to concentrate on a particular aspect, you would need to discuss this with your advisor, who will then add the concentration to your profile. However, not all majors require or offer concentrations; for example, the B.S. in Physics does not have one.

Response: An integrative course is an upper-division course that incorporates one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core into the curriculum of a student's major. These courses aim to integrate foundational skills or knowledge from the Core into higher-level classes, allowing for increased awareness and attention to these skills throughout the student's academic journey.

Integrative learning goes beyond merely experiencing the material; it involves learning from the experience and connecting it to academic study. The final goal is applying the learned concepts to problem-solving and decision-making processes.

In the context of the University of South Carolina, integrative courses may include reflections, analysis of values, ethics, and social responsibility within the specific discipline area, service-learning opportunities, internships, or other field experiences that encourage study, reflection, and social action. Once approved by the Faculty Senate, the integrative course will be recorded in Degree Works.

Response: Progression requirements refer to the minimum criteria that students must meet to continue advancing in their academic programs at the University of South Carolina (USC). These requirements typically include maintaining a certain GPA, successfully completing specific courses, and fulfilling any program-specific progression requirements as outlined in each department's section of the USC bulletin. Additionally, some programs may have lab-designated progression courses that students need to pass. It is important to note that these requirements can be subject to change, and students should consult their academic advisors or the relevant department for the most up-to-date information regarding their progression requirements.

Response: The difference between prerequisites and restrictions lies in their impact on course enrollment. A prerequisite refers to specific academic requirements or qualifications that a student must meet before enrolling in a particular course. These requirements ensure that students have the necessary background knowledge or skills to succeed in the class. On the other hand, restrictions limit enrollment based on factors other than academic preparedness, such as major, class standing, or enrollment status (e.g., full-time vs. part-time). Restrictions help manage course capacity and maintain balance among different student populations.

Response: An undergraduate degree program at the University of South Carolina typically involves completing all required coursework within the chosen major or field of study. This can be done through traditional on-campus classes, online courses, or a combination of both, depending on what format best suits the student's needs and schedule. Students should consult the Undergraduate Bulletin (<http://bulletin.sc.edu/>) for specific degree requirements, course descriptions, and academic regulations. It's essential to complete all necessary coursework and meet all requirements set forth by the university to earn the desired undergraduate degree.

Response: The process for course actions at the University of South Carolina involves creating an Action Plan when repeating a course. This plan outlines specific goals, actions, and criteria that must be met in order to progress. In the College of Education, students may repeat one course they received an unsatisfactory grade in, but this opportunity is limited to once per course.

For transfer courses, there is a separate approval process. The details of this process can vary depending on the specific circumstances, so it's best to consult with an academic advisor or other appropriate university official for guidance. They can help ensure that the transfer courses align with your degree requirements and are accepted by the university.

In general, it's important to stay proactive and engaged in your academic journey, keeping open lines of communication with your academic advisors and other university resources. By doing so, you can better navigate the course action process and make the most of your educational experience at USC.

2024-12-12 03:38:50,630 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: Cross-listed courses typically require additional proposals when there is a significant change in course description, a shift in Carolina Core or GLD designation, or an alteration in delivery mode to over 50% online. In these cases, submitting a full proposal with a corresponding syllabus would be necessary for the review process. However, if none of these changes apply, then only letters of concurrence from all involved units might suffice for the cross-listing. Kindly ensure that you are familiar with USC's guidelines and requirements before proceeding with the submission.

Response: A syllabus is typically not required for a proposal, as it is usually an outline or summary of what will be covered in a course or project. However, if the proposal is for a specific course, such as those numbered 500-600 level courses, a detailed syllabus would need to be provided before or during the first class session. This syllabus should include information about course objectives, assignments, grading criteria, and expectations for both undergraduate and graduate students. It is essential to ensure that all graduate students meet the requirements for graduate credit when providing a syllabus for a course proposal.

2024-12-12 03:39:04,283 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: If you need to request a correction for DegreeWorks, it is best to first contact your academic advisor. They can help assess whether the issue requires an update in DegreeWorks or if it can be resolved through other means. Keep in mind that during peak registration times, there might be a slight delay in getting a response from your advisor. While DegreeWorks is a useful tool for tracking progress towards graduation, it is not considered the official record of your degree requirements. Therefore, corrections should typically be made by working with your advisor instead of contacting the Registrar directly.

Response: Faculty members should be aware of DegreeWorks because it plays a crucial role in tracking students' progress towards their degrees. By understanding how DegreeWorks works, faculty can better advise students on course selection and academic planning. Furthermore, since the College of Arts and Sciences collaborates with the Registrar’s office to ensure DegreeWorks' efficiency, faculty may also contribute to refining this tool and enhancing its functionality for the benefit of all students. Overall, familiarity with DegreeWorks allows faculty to support students more effectively in achieving their academic goals at the University of South Carolina.

2024-12-12 03:39:12,188 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: In general, whether or not your proposal requires a letter of concurrence depends on the specific guidelines provided by the funding agency. It is essential to carefully review their instructions and requirements. However, since you mentioned submitting a Letter of Intent instead of a full proposal, it is unlikely that a letter of concurrence would be necessary at this stage. Nevertheless, I recommend checking with your Sponsored Awards Management (SAM) representative at the University of South Carolina (USC) for clarification regarding your specific situation. They can provide guidance tailored to the funding opportunity and ensure compliance with USC policies.

Response: At the University of South Carolina (USC), when you submit an external proposal, it needs to go through an internal approval process. Once you create and save a new proposal in USCeRA, you should allow at least three business days for your unit head and dean's office to review it before the sponsor's due date. They might request corrections if they have questions. The proposal requires endorsement/approval from the unit chair or director. Please note that this internal approval process is separate from any external approvals required by the sponsor.

Response: The drop/add/withdrawal (W) dates refer to specific deadlines within each academic semester at the University of South Carolina (USC). These dates impact how course changes affect tuition and fees, as well as textbook charges. Let me break down what each term means:

- **Drop:** This is the deadline for dropping a course without it appearing on your transcript. If you drop a course before this date, you will receive a full refund of tuition and fees, as well as any applicable textbook charges.

- **Add:** This is the deadline to add a new course to your schedule. After this date, you cannot add any additional courses for the semester.

- **Withdrawal (W):** This is the last day to withdraw from a course with a grade of 'W' on your transcript. Withdrawing after the drop date but before the withdrawal date will result in a partial refund of tuition and fees, but textbook charges will not be refunded.

To sum up, whether you get money back for dropped classes depends on the timing of the drop relative to the established drop/add/withdrawal dates for the given semester. To find the exact dates for the current or upcoming semesters, please consult the [USC Drop/Add/Refund Dates](https://banner.onecarolina.sc.edu/BannerExtensibility/customPage/page/z_spg_codes-dates?mepCode=COL) webpage.

Response: Failing a class can impact your academic standing at the University of South Carolina. It may result in a lower grade point average (GPA) and could potentially place you on academic probation if your cumulative GPA falls below certain thresholds. However, it's important to remember that one failed class does not necessarily mean you will be dismissed from the university.

If you find yourself failing a class, consider speaking with your professor to discuss possible solutions or strategies for improving your performance. You might also want to reach out to an academic advisor who can help guide you through this situation and provide resources such as tutoring services or study groups.

Remember, handling a failed class early on can prevent further academic difficulties down the road. Stay proactive, seek assistance when needed, and continue working diligently towards achieving your academic goals at USC.

Response: If you find yourself unable to enroll in a required course due to it being full, there are several steps you can take. Firstly, regularly check the registration system as spots may become available due to other students dropping or switching classes. Secondly, consider reaching out to the academic department offering the course to inquire about possible options such as overloading the class or waiting lists. Lastly, if these methods prove unsuccessful, consult with your academic advisor who can help explore alternative courses that fulfill similar requirements. Remember, it's essential to address this issue promptly to ensure timely progress towards your degree.

This way, you can still show your support and pride for the University of South Carolina community even if you're unable to join us in person. Thank you for understanding!

Response: If you have applied for graduation and meet the eligibility requirements, you can expect to receive an email regarding tickets around April 19. This email will include instructions on how to obtain your tickets. If you haven't received an email by then, it's recommended to check your spam folder or contact the appropriate office to ensure your application was processed correctly. Remember, ticketing updates are made daily, usually in the afternoon.

Response: It seems like the context provides two different scenarios for ticket allocation. If you're attending a Baccalaureate, Masters, or Professional Commencement Ceremony at the University of South Carolina, you will receive up to five tickets for your guests. On the other hand, if you order individual subscriptions, you will receive six tickets per subscription to use as desired throughout the season. To determine which situation applies to your case, please provide more details about the specific event or subscription you're referring to.

Response: Dear user,

Based on the provided context, dual degree graduates can choose to sit with the college of their preference. However, there might be certain regulations specific to each dual degree program that could affect this decision. It is essential for students to consult the Dual Degree Program guidelines and discuss their choices with their respective academic advisors. This way, they can ensure they meet all degree requirements and make informed decisions regarding their academic careers at the University of South Carolina.

Best regards,
Your USC Chatbot

Response: To ensure your name is pronounced correctly during the University of South Carolina commencement ceremonies, you should follow these steps:
1. Watch out for emails from Marching Order, a third-party vendor managing name pronunciations for the event.
2. Record your name as you would like it to be pronounced on their portal before the deadline.
3. If your name is not spelled correctly on your card, you can find blank cards at the ceremony to write it down properly.
4. If your name is hard to pronounce, consider writing it phonetically on the card or whispering it to the reader as you approach.

Response: At the University of South Carolina, we currently offer two interdisciplinary majors and six area minors. While I cannot provide specific details about upcoming announcements regarding new majors, minors, or concentrations, it is common for universities to regularly review and update their academic programs to meet the evolving needs of students and society.

Response: It seems like your degree status is still listed as pending because the final review process has not been completed yet. This is normal and can take some time after graduation. To check the current status of your degree, you can log into my.sc.edu and view your academic transcript. Once your degree is listed as awarded on your transcript, you can then proceed with submitting your transcript order for your diploma. The mailing time for diplomas may vary, so keep an eye on your email for updates regarding its delivery.

Please note that some courses might require special permission from the instructor or department before allowing registration.

Response: Online students at the University of South Carolina are not required to provide immunization records when initially enrolling; however, they can choose to submit them to lift any potential immunization holds. If you decide to submit your immunization records, you won't need to resubmit them for future semesters. However, if you prefer not to submit your records, you must fill out the Distance Learner Exemption Form every semester to avoid having an immunization hold. Keep in mind that some programs with clinical components may still require official immunization records regardless of whether you're studying online or on campus.

Obtaining a library card is simple – you will immediately receive a card number upon request, allowing you to take advantage of these valuable resources.

Response: Online exams at the University of South Carolina are administered using WebCt, which allows for oral, written, and practical questions. To ensure a smooth experience, consider submitting a request through the Self-Service Portal or consulting the online Knowledge Base. Additionally, take advantage of the opportunity to complete a practice exam to familiarize yourself with the online testing environment. Remember, if you encounter any issues or need assistance, you can chat with a Service Desk technician during their available hours. In order to maintain academic integrity, it's essential to create an effective testing environment at home and follow guidelines provided by email and the exam instructions. As an alternative to traditional high-stakes exams, you might also expect shorter, more frequent assessments throughout the course.

Response: An "overload" generally refers to a situation where someone is taking on more work or responsibility than usual. In the context provided, an overload seems to be related to academic coursework, specifically when a student requests to take on additional sections or classes beyond their regular course load. The reasons for an overload may vary, but it could be due to factors such as scheduling conflicts, specific course requirements, or other academic needs. Keep in mind that if you're considering requesting an overload, there might be policies and procedures in place at the University of South Carolina that you should follow, so it's best to consult with the appropriate offices or staff members for guidance.

Response: The pass/fail option at the University of South Carolina allows students to take certain courses without receiving a traditional letter grade (A-F). Instead, they will receive either a "pass" or "fail" designation on their transcript. This can help reduce academic pressure and encourage exploration of new subjects. However, it's essential to note that some programs may have restrictions on how many classes can be taken pass/fail or which specific courses are eligible for this grading option. Students should consult with their academic advisor before choosing the pass/fail grading basis for any course.

Response: Yes, you can take courses at another institution during the summer as long as you meet certain requirements. You must be in good standing at your current institution, eligible to return, and have institutional permission to enroll in a specific course. The University of South Carolina (USC) also offers hundreds of summer courses, many of which are available online. This means you can be enrolled full-time and still go home for the summer. Summer courses at USC are typically offered in June and July.

2024-12-12 03:43:05,245 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: A second major is an additional area of study that you can choose to pursue alongside your primary major. At the University of South Carolina's College of Arts and Sciences, if you decide to take a second major, you will need to fulfill all the collegiate requirements including general education courses and specific departmental requirements for both majors. In case your first and second major lead to different degrees, you must declare one as the official degree of record. A second major waives the cognate requirement but does not necessarily waive all special departmental requirements usually completed as part of the cognate. Upon graduation, the completion of a second major will be indicated on your official transcript. However, no notation for a second major will appear on the transcript for coursework completed after graduation.

2024-12-12 03:43:08,482 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: A second degree refers to when a student earns two distinct degrees from the University of South Carolina. This could involve applying for both degrees simultaneously or sequentially, resulting in two separate diplomas. Completing a second major does not automatically lead to a second degree; instead, it requires filing a separate degree application for each degree with the appropriate college or school. It's important to note that having two majors typically results in one diploma, while pursuing two separate degrees results in receiving two diplomas.

Response: I'm sorry to hear that you're facing challenges affecting your academic performance at the University of South Carolina. Here are some steps you can take when dealing with extenuating circumstances:

1. Document your situation: Gather any relevant documentation, such as medical records, police reports, or letters from professionals involved in your situation. This evidence will help support your request for accommodations.

2. Contact your professors: Reach out to your instructors as soon as possible to inform them about your circumstances and discuss potential solutions. They might offer alternatives like extensions, make-up assignments, or alternative assessments.

3. Seek assistance from Support Services: Utilize resources available through the University's Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC), Counseling and Psychiatry, or other relevant departments. These offices can provide guidance, accommodations, and additional support during difficult times.

4. Follow University policies: Make sure to adhere to the guidelines outlined in Rule 1 regarding academic dismissals due to failure to meet academic requirements. Familiarize yourself with the process and requirements for petitioning for exceptions.

5. Submit a petition: If your circumstances warrant it, consider submitting a petition to the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Be prepared to present detailed information about your situation, supporting documentation, and a clear plan for improvement.

Remember, it's essential to communicate openly with your professors and seek help from university resources to address extenuating circumstances effectively. Good luck!

Response: In the specific case of the Ph.D. in Marine Science program at the University of South Carolina, applicants can indeed apply to more than one concentration simultaneously. However, it's essential to note that once admitted into the program, students must choose only one concentration for their studies. This means that while you can express interest in multiple concentrations during the application process, you will eventually need to focus on just one of them for your degree requirements.

Response: Yes, you can choose specific courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program at the University of South Carolina. The Carolina Core consists of required courses with uniform learning outcomes that apply to all students, regardless of their major. While there are certain prescribed courses within each category of the Carolina Core, you have the flexibility to select from a variety of approved options that best align with your interests and academic goals. It's essential to review the list of courses satisfying Carolina Core requirements on the university's website and consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're making the most informed decisions for your educational journey. Keep in mind that courses used to satisfy Carolina Core requirements may not also be used to fulfill minor requirements.

2024-12-12 03:46:46,277 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: When making changes to a cross-listed course, it is essential to consider how these alterations may impact any associated cross-listed courses. However, whether all changes directly affect the cross-listed courses depends on the nature of the modifications. For instance, if there are adjustments to prerequisites, corequisites, or cross-listings themselves, then those changes will undoubtedly influence the connected courses. On the other hand, minor edits to the course description without affecting the course content, learning objectives, or assessment methods might not necessarily impact the cross-listed courses.

In terms of syllabi submission for cross-listed courses, it is required when introducing new courses or significantly changing course descriptions, Carolina Core or GLD designations, or delivery modes to over 50% online. This policy ensures that any substantial modifications undergo thorough examination and approval before implementation.

Lastly, regarding course bulletin descriptions and cross-listing submissions, it is crucial to ensure that all cross-listed courses have been uploaded timely and their bulletin descriptions are identical. This consistency facilitates a smooth review process and helps maintain the integrity of the academic offerings at the University of South Carolina.

2024-12-12 03:46:46,904 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: No, prerequisites do not necessarily have to be enforced in Banner during registration. However, it's essential to ensure that you meet all the prerequisites of the courses you intend to take. This is because Banner may prevent you from registering if you haven't satisfied the necessary prerequisites.

If you find yourself in a situation where you don't meet the prerequisites for a specific course, there might still be an opportunity to request an override. To learn more about overrides and their corresponding forms, consult the appropriate resources provided by the University of South Carolina.

Ultimately, discussing your concerns with your academic advisor is highly recommended. They can assess your situation and guide you through the process of obtaining a prerequisite waiver or override if needed.

2024-12-12 03:46:47,539 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: Carolina Core Overlay courses are a unique type of course at the University of South Carolina that allows students to fulfill multiple requirements with just one class. These overlays focus on developing essential skills such as public speaking and information literacy, making them particularly valuable for students pursuing various disciplines.

When taking an Overlay course, students have the opportunity to meet two requirements within a single course – but at least one of these overlays must stand alone and not be used to satisfy other parts of the Carolina Core. It's important to consult your specific major checklist or consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're selecting the right Overlay courses to meet your degree requirements.

To give you an idea of what to look for, approved Carolina Core Overlay courses should address specific learning outcomes from the Carolina Core, such as those related to Communication Skills (CMS), Information Literacy (INF), or Values, Ethics, and Social Responsibility (VSR). Additionally, the college or department responsible for offering the course should demonstrate expertise in the content area associated with the learning outcome.

For example, if a student takes HIST 108, it can serve as both a Non-US History course and a VSR overlay, helping them progress toward their graduation goals. By understanding how Carolina Core Overlay courses work, students like you can make informed decisions about which classes will best support your academic success!

Response: To change your program learning outcomes at the University of South Carolina, follow these steps:

1. Log into APPS (Academic Program Planning System) using your USC credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Program Learning Outcomes" section for your specific program.
3. Carefully review the existing learning outcomes, ensuring they remain clear, simple, and measurable.
4. Make necessary adjustments or additions to the learning outcomes, keeping in mind that they should align with your course content and reflect the desired student competencies upon completion of the program.
5. Save your changes and submit them for approval through the appropriate channels within the university. This may involve obtaining approval from department chairs, deans, or other university officials.
6. Keep track of your submitted changes and monitor their progress until they are officially approved and implemented.

Remember that learning outcomes should be reviewed and adjusted periodically as you become more familiar with students' abilities and changing academic expectations. Always strive to create learning outcomes that are relevant, current, and aligned with best practices in higher education.

Response: A curriculum change proposal is typically required when making significant modifications to a course or program of study. However, non-curricular information such as faculty listings, contact information, and college or departmental descriptive text can be updated directly by contacting the Office of the University Registrar. For minor updates or corrections to course descriptions, you might not need a full curriculum change proposal; instead, you could reach out to the appropriate university committee for guidance. If you're unsure whether your intended changes require a curriculum change proposal, it would be best to consult with the Curriculum Committee or an academic advisor at the University of South Carolina.

Response: To propose a program action at the University of South Carolina, you should first familiarize yourself with the goals and objectives of your specific program. Once you have identified an area for improvement or change, consider discussing your ideas with fellow students, faculty advisors, or other relevant stakeholders. This can help refine your proposal and gather support from those directly affected by the proposed action.

Next, draft a clear and concise proposal outlining the issue, your suggested solution, and any anticipated benefits or challenges. Be sure to include any necessary data or research to support your claims. Submit your proposal to the appropriate administrator or committee within your program or department, typically through a designated process or channel.

Keep in mind that successful program actions often involve collaboration, communication, and compromise between various parties. Stay open to feedback and willing to adjust your proposal as needed to ensure its alignment with the overall mission and values of the University of South Carolina.

Response: The time it takes for a proposal to receive all levels of approval can vary but typically may take several months. After submission, the proposal undergoes review by curriculum committees during the second week of each month. Once reviewed, it moves forward for a funding decision which can take six to nine months. Additionally, required approvals as outlined in the guidelines may also contribute to this timeline. Please note that you'll be notified within 10 business days whether or not you have been approved. For specific questions regarding the approval process, feel free to contact Wanda Barr at (803) 777-1875 or wandab@mailbox.sc.edu.

Response: If you are pursuing a degree in Business Administration at USC, changing your concentration will only affect the specific area of study you choose to specialize in. The seven concentration options include Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Real Estate, Supply Chain Management, and Entrepreneurship. Each concentration has its unique course requirements and focuses on different aspects of business administration. However, if you're in the Master of Arts in Teaching program with three concentration options, changing your concentration would alter your entire program's focus. In this case, the three concentrations are Elementary Education, Middle Level Education, or Secondary Education. Please let me know if you need more information about either of these programs!

Response: In this context, critical courses on major maps refer to essential courses within a specific program of study that must be completed as part of the degree requirements. They typically form the foundation of the discipline and provide students with fundamental knowledge and skills necessary for success in their chosen field. Critical courses may vary depending on the major, so it's essential to consult the appropriate major map for detailed information on these courses. Keep in mind that while major maps offer a suggested sequence of courses, consulting an academic advisor can help clarify the application of specific coursework to a program of study and provide guidance on course selection and planning for future semesters.

Response: A major map at the University of South Carolina is a layout of required courses in a specific program of study, outlining critical courses and suggesting course sequences to help ensure a clear path to graduation. These maps serve as a guide for students pursuing their chosen field and are only a suggested or recommended sequence of courses required in the program. It is essential to consult an academic advisor for assistance in applying specific coursework to the program, as well as guidance on course selection and planning for future semesters. Additionally, all changes must be registered with the College Academic Affairs and Advising Office.

Response: A cross-listed course at the University of South Carolina (USC) refers to a single course that is offered by two or more departments with different prefixes but identical content, credit hours, and learning objectives. In this case, the requirements for a cross-listed course will depend on the specific department offering the course as its prerequisites. However, generally, if a student satisfies the prerequisites for one of the cross-listed courses, they are considered to meet the requirements for all other cross-listed versions of that course. For example, if a student meets the prerequisites for HIST 301, they would also satisfy the prerequisites for HUM 301 if it is cross-listed with HIST 301.

Response: At the University of South Carolina - Columbia, there isn't a strict requirement for a syllabus as it may vary depending on the course or instructor. However, a well-constructed syllabus typically outlines what is to be learned, how learning will occur, and how learning will be evaluated. Additionally, you might receive an email with specific details about what should be included in your syllabus. Ultimately, the syllabus serves as a crucial guide for students throughout the course, establishing expectations, standards, and overall structure.

Response: A cognate is a cluster of advanced-level courses (typically 12 credits) that relate to your major but aren't directly a part of it. For example, if you're studying Marine Science, Environmental Science, or Environmental Studies, you don't need a cognate. However, if you're studying Geological Sciences, you will need one. A cognate allows you to explore topics related to your major in greater depth, providing an opportunity to tailor your studies to your interests and career goals. It will appear on your academic transcript but not on your diploma. The specific courses that make up your cognate will be determined in consultation with your major advisor.

Response: A concentration is a specialized set of courses within a major field of study, allowing students to focus on specific areas of interest. It provides an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and skills in a particular subject. In the context of the University of South Carolina, concentrations can be added to your degree plan by consulting with your academic advisor. For instance, if you're studying physics and wish to concentrate on a particular aspect, you would need to discuss this with your advisor, who will then add the concentration to your profile. However, not all majors require or offer concentrations; for example, the B.S. in Physics does not have one.

Response: An integrative course is an upper-division course that incorporates one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core into the curriculum of a student's major. These courses aim to integrate foundational skills or knowledge from the Core into higher-level classes, allowing for increased awareness and attention to these skills throughout the student's academic journey.

Integrative learning goes beyond merely experiencing the material; it involves learning from the experience and connecting it to academic study. The final goal is applying the learned concepts to problem-solving and decision-making processes.

In the context of the University of South Carolina, integrative courses may include reflections, analysis of values, ethics, and social responsibility within the specific discipline area, service-learning opportunities, internships, or other field experiences that encourage study, reflection, and social action. Once approved by the Faculty Senate, the integrative course will be recorded in Degree Works.

Response: Progression requirements refer to the minimum criteria that students must meet to continue advancing in their academic programs at the University of South Carolina (USC). These requirements typically include maintaining a certain GPA, successfully completing specific courses, and fulfilling any program-specific progression requirements as outlined in each department's section of the USC bulletin. Additionally, some programs may have lab-designated progression courses that students need to pass. It is important to note that these requirements can be subject to change, and students should consult their academic advisors or the relevant department for the most up-to-date information regarding their progression requirements.

Response: The Carolina Core is a set of foundational courses at the University of South Carolina (USC) designed to ensure students gain essential skills and knowledge during their undergraduate education. These courses cover various disciplines, including English, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, and foreign languages. The Carolina Core aims to provide a well-rounded academic experience, fostering critical thinking, effective communication, and global awareness among USC students. More specific details about the Carolina Core can be found within the AIU, GHS US, or other relevant course codes you mentioned; however, I don't have direct access to those particular course details. For complete information, I recommend visiting the USC website or contacting the university directly.

Response: The difference between prerequisites and restrictions lies in their impact on course enrollment. A prerequisite refers to specific academic requirements or qualifications that a student must meet before enrolling in a particular course. These requirements ensure that students have the necessary background knowledge or skills to succeed in the class. On the other hand, restrictions limit enrollment based on factors other than academic preparedness, such as major, class standing, or enrollment status (e.g., full-time vs. part-time). Restrictions help manage course capacity and maintain balance among different student populations.

Response: An undergraduate degree program at the University of South Carolina typically involves completing all required coursework within the chosen major or field of study. This can be done through traditional on-campus classes, online courses, or a combination of both, depending on what format best suits the student's needs and schedule. Students should consult the Undergraduate Bulletin (<http://bulletin.sc.edu/>) for specific degree requirements, course descriptions, and academic regulations. It's essential to complete all necessary coursework and meet all requirements set forth by the university to earn the desired undergraduate degree.

Response: The process for course actions at the University of South Carolina involves creating an Action Plan when repeating a course. This plan outlines specific goals, actions, and criteria that must be met in order to progress. In the College of Education, students may repeat one course they received an unsatisfactory grade in, but this opportunity is limited to once per course.

For transfer courses, there is a separate approval process. The details of this process can vary depending on the specific circumstances, so it's best to consult with an academic advisor or other appropriate university official for guidance. They can help ensure that the transfer courses align with your degree requirements and are accepted by the university.

In general, it's important to stay proactive and engaged in your academic journey, keeping open lines of communication with your academic advisors and other university resources. By doing so, you can better navigate the course action process and make the most of your educational experience at USC.

2024-12-12 03:47:02,541 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: Cross-listed courses typically require additional proposals when there is a significant change in course description, a shift in Carolina Core or GLD designation, or an alteration in delivery mode to over 50% online. In these cases, submitting a full proposal with a corresponding syllabus would be necessary for the review process. However, if none of these changes apply, then only letters of concurrence from all involved units might suffice for the cross-listing. Kindly ensure that you are familiar with USC's guidelines and requirements before proceeding with the submission.

Response: A syllabus is typically not required for a proposal, as it is usually an outline or summary of what will be covered in a course or project. However, if the proposal is for a specific course, such as those numbered 500-600 level courses, a detailed syllabus would need to be provided before or during the first class session. This syllabus should include information about course objectives, assignments, grading criteria, and expectations for both undergraduate and graduate students. It is essential to ensure that all graduate students meet the requirements for graduate credit when providing a syllabus for a course proposal.

2024-12-12 03:47:06,899 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: If you need to request a correction for DegreeWorks, it is best to first contact your academic advisor. They can help assess whether the issue requires an update in DegreeWorks or if it can be resolved through other means. Keep in mind that during peak registration times, there might be a slight delay in getting a response from your advisor. While DegreeWorks is a useful tool for tracking progress towards graduation, it is not considered the official record of your degree requirements. Therefore, corrections should typically be made by working with your advisor instead of contacting the Registrar directly.

Response: Faculty members should be aware of DegreeWorks because it plays a crucial role in tracking students' progress towards their degrees. By understanding how DegreeWorks works, faculty can better advise students on course selection and academic planning. Furthermore, since the College of Arts and Sciences collaborates with the Registrar’s office to ensure DegreeWorks' efficiency, faculty may also contribute to refining this tool and enhancing its functionality for the benefit of all students. Overall, familiarity with DegreeWorks allows faculty to support students more effectively in achieving their academic goals at the University of South Carolina.

2024-12-12 03:47:08,754 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: In general, whether or not your proposal requires a letter of concurrence depends on the specific guidelines provided by the funding agency. It is essential to carefully review their instructions and requirements. However, since you mentioned submitting a Letter of Intent instead of a full proposal, it is unlikely that a letter of concurrence would be necessary at this stage. Nevertheless, I recommend checking with your Sponsored Awards Management (SAM) representative at the University of South Carolina (USC) for clarification regarding your specific situation. They can provide guidance tailored to the funding opportunity and ensure compliance with USC policies.

Response: At the University of South Carolina (USC), when you submit an external proposal, it needs to go through an internal approval process. Once you create and save a new proposal in USCeRA, you should allow at least three business days for your unit head and dean's office to review it before the sponsor's due date. They might request corrections if they have questions. The proposal requires endorsement/approval from the unit chair or director. Please note that this internal approval process is separate from any external approvals required by the sponsor.

Response: The drop/add/withdrawal (W) dates refer to specific deadlines within each academic semester at the University of South Carolina (USC). These dates impact how course changes affect tuition and fees, as well as textbook charges. Let me break down what each term means:

- **Drop:** This is the deadline for dropping a course without it appearing on your transcript. If you drop a course before this date, you will receive a full refund of tuition and fees, as well as any applicable textbook charges.

- **Add:** This is the deadline to add a new course to your schedule. After this date, you cannot add any additional courses for the semester.

- **Withdrawal (W):** This is the last day to withdraw from a course with a grade of 'W' on your transcript. Withdrawing after the drop date but before the withdrawal date will result in a partial refund of tuition and fees, but textbook charges will not be refunded.

To sum up, whether you get money back for dropped classes depends on the timing of the drop relative to the established drop/add/withdrawal dates for the given semester. To find the exact dates for the current or upcoming semesters, please consult the [USC Drop/Add/Refund Dates](https://banner.onecarolina.sc.edu/BannerExtensibility/customPage/page/z_spg_codes-dates?mepCode=COL) webpage.

Response: Failing a class can impact your academic standing at the University of South Carolina. It may result in a lower grade point average (GPA) and could potentially place you on academic probation if your cumulative GPA falls below certain thresholds. However, it's important to remember that one failed class does not necessarily mean you will be dismissed from the university.

If you find yourself failing a class, consider speaking with your professor to discuss possible solutions or strategies for improving your performance. You might also want to reach out to an academic advisor who can help guide you through this situation and provide resources such as tutoring services or study groups.

Remember, handling a failed class early on can prevent further academic difficulties down the road. Stay proactive, seek assistance when needed, and continue working diligently towards achieving your academic goals at USC.

Response: If you find yourself unable to enroll in a required course due to it being full, there are several steps you can take. Firstly, regularly check the registration system as spots may become available due to other students dropping or switching classes. Secondly, consider reaching out to the academic department offering the course to inquire about possible options such as overloading the class or waiting lists. Lastly, if these methods prove unsuccessful, consult with your academic advisor who can help explore alternative courses that fulfill similar requirements. Remember, it's essential to address this issue promptly to ensure timely progress towards your degree.

Response: If you have applied for graduation and meet the eligibility requirements, you can expect to receive an email regarding tickets around April 19. This email will include instructions on how to obtain your tickets. If you haven't received an email by then, it's recommended to check your spam folder or contact the appropriate office to ensure your application was processed correctly. Remember, ticketing updates are made daily, usually in the afternoon.

Response: It seems like the context provides two different scenarios for ticket allocation. If you're attending a Baccalaureate, Masters, or Professional Commencement Ceremony at the University of South Carolina, you will receive up to five tickets for your guests. On the other hand, if you order individual subscriptions, you will receive six tickets per subscription to use as desired throughout the season. To determine which situation applies to your case, please provide more details about the specific event or subscription you're referring to.

Response: Dear user,

Based on the provided context, dual degree graduates can choose to sit with the college of their preference.

This way, they can ensure they meet all degree requirements and make informed decisions regarding their academic careers at the University of South Carolina.

Response: To ensure your name is pronounced correctly during the University of South Carolina commencement ceremonies, you should follow these steps:
1. Watch out for emails from Marching Order, a third-party vendor managing name pronunciations for the event.
2. Record your name as you would like it to be pronounced on their portal before the deadline.
3. If your name is not spelled correctly on your card, you can find blank cards at the ceremony to write it down properly.
4. If your name is hard to pronounce, consider writing it phonetically on the card or whispering it to the reader as you approach.

Response: At the University of South Carolina, we currently offer two interdisciplinary majors and six area minors. While I cannot provide specific details about upcoming announcements regarding new majors, minors, or concentrations, it is common for universities to regularly review and update their academic programs to meet the evolving needs of students and society. I encourage you to stay connected with USC's official communication channels for the latest news and updates about our academic offerings.

To check the current status of your degree, you can log into my.sc.edu and view your academic transcript. Once your degree is listed as awarded on your transcript, you can then proceed with submitting your transcript order for your diploma. The mailing time for diplomas may vary, so keep an eye on your email for updates regarding its delivery.

Response: To register for an online course with a restriction, first ensure that you meet all prerequisites and other requirements for the course. Once you confirm eligibility, follow these steps:
1. Log into my.sc.edu using your VIP ID and password.
2. Navigate to Self Service > Student > Registration > Add/Drop Classes.
3. Enter the five-digit Course Reference Number (CRN) of the desired online course in the "Add Classes Worksheet" and click "Submit Changes."
4. If you encounter a restriction, carefully read the fine print associated with the CRN or course name for specific details about the restriction.
5. Follow the instructions provided in the registration holds and course restrictions document, which outlines how to proceed depending on the type of restriction. This may involve contacting the academic department offering the course or submitting a permit request through the registrar's office.
6. After addressing the restriction, continue with the registration process by clicking "Submit Changes" again.

Please note that some courses might require special permission from the instructor or department before allowing registration. Always double-check the course details and restrictions before attempting to register. If you still need assistance, consider reaching out to the Undergraduate Admissions Office or the Graduate School for guidance. Good luck with your registration!

Response: Online students at the University of South Carolina are not required to provide immunization records when initially enrolling; however, they can choose to submit them to lift any potential immunization holds. If you decide to submit your immunization records, you won't need to resubmit them for future semesters. However, if you prefer not to submit your records, you must fill out the Distance Learner Exemption Form every semester to avoid having an immunization hold. Keep in mind that some programs with clinical components may still require official immunization records regardless of whether you're studying online or on campus.

Response: Online exams at the University of South Carolina are administered using WebCt, which allows for oral, written, and practical questions. To ensure a smooth experience, consider submitting a request through the Self-Service Portal or consulting the online Knowledge Base. Additionally, take advantage of the opportunity to complete a practice exam to familiarize yourself with the online testing environment. Remember, if you encounter any issues or need assistance, you can chat with a Service Desk technician during their available hours. In order to maintain academic integrity, it's essential to create an effective testing environment at home and follow guidelines provided by email and the exam instructions. As an alternative to traditional high-stakes exams, you might also expect shorter, more frequent assessments throughout the course.

Response: An "overload" generally refers to a situation where someone is taking on more work or responsibility than usual. In the context provided, an overload seems to be related to academic coursework, specifically when a student requests to take on additional sections or classes beyond their regular course load. The reasons for an overload may vary, but it could be due to factors such as scheduling conflicts, specific course requirements, or other academic needs. Keep in mind that if you're considering requesting an overload, there might be policies and procedures in place at the University of South Carolina that you should follow, so it's best to consult with the appropriate offices or staff members for guidance.

Response: The pass/fail option at the University of South Carolina allows students to take certain courses without receiving a traditional letter grade (A-F). Instead, they will receive either a "pass" or "fail" designation on their transcript. This can help reduce academic pressure and encourage exploration of new subjects. However, it's essential to note that some programs may have restrictions on how many classes can be taken pass/fail or which specific courses are eligible for this grading option. Students should consult with their academic advisor before choosing the pass/fail grading basis for any course.

Response: Yes, you can take courses at another institution during the summer as long as you meet certain requirements. You must be in good standing at your current institution, eligible to return, and have institutional permission to enroll in a specific course. The University of South Carolina (USC) also offers hundreds of summer courses, many of which are available online. This means you can be enrolled full-time and still go home for the summer. Summer courses at USC are typically offered in June and July.

2024-12-12 03:47:52,178 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: A second major is an additional area of study that you can choose to pursue alongside your primary major. At the University of South Carolina's College of Arts and Sciences, if you decide to take a second major, you will need to fulfill all the collegiate requirements including general education courses and specific departmental requirements for both majors. In case your first and second major lead to different degrees, you must declare one as the official degree of record. A second major waives the cognate requirement but does not necessarily waive all special departmental requirements usually completed as part of the cognate. Upon graduation, the completion of a second major will be indicated on your official transcript. However, no notation for a second major will appear on the transcript for coursework completed after graduation.

2024-12-12 03:47:52,808 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: A second degree refers to when a student earns two distinct degrees from the University of South Carolina. This could involve applying for both degrees simultaneously or sequentially, resulting in two separate diplomas. Completing a second major does not automatically lead to a second degree; instead, it requires filing a separate degree application for each degree with the appropriate college or school. It's important to note that having two majors typically results in one diploma, while pursuing two separate degrees results in receiving two diplomas.

Response: I'm sorry to hear that you're facing challenges affecting your academic performance at the University of South Carolina. Here are some steps you can take when dealing with extenuating circumstances:

1. Document your situation: Gather any relevant documentation, such as medical records, police reports, or letters from professionals involved in your situation. This evidence will help support your request for accommodations.

2. Contact your professors: Reach out to your instructors as soon as possible to inform them about your circumstances and discuss potential solutions. They might offer alternatives like extensions, make-up assignments, or alternative assessments.

3. Seek assistance from Support Services: Utilize resources available through the University's Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC), Counseling and Psychiatry, or other relevant departments. These offices can provide guidance, accommodations, and additional support during difficult times.

4. Follow University policies: Make sure to adhere to the guidelines outlined in Rule 1 regarding academic dismissals due to failure to meet academic requirements. Familiarize yourself with the process and requirements for petitioning for exceptions.

5. Submit a petition: If your circumstances warrant it, consider submitting a petition to the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Be prepared to present detailed information about your situation, supporting documentation, and a clear plan for improvement.

Remember, it's essential to communicate openly with your professors and seek help from university resources to address extenuating circumstances effectively. Good luck!

Response: Yes, when making changes to a cross-listed course, it affects all cross-listed courses associated with it. This includes updates to course descriptions, prerequisites, learning outcomes, and other aspects of the course syllabus. It's crucial to ensure that all cross-listed courses remain consistent and up-to-date to avoid confusion for students. Therefore, when proposing changes to a cross-listed course, keep in mind that these modifications will impact all related courses within the cross-listing.

Response: Yes, prerequisites generally must be enforced in Banner when signing up for classes at the University of South Carolina. This means that if you want to register for a specific course, you typically need to have completed the required prerequisites first. The purpose of this system is to ensure that students have the necessary background knowledge and skills to succeed in more advanced courses.

However, there may be some situations where prerequisites can be waived. For instance, if you believe you have the appropriate knowledge or experience despite not meeting the prerequisites, you can discuss this with your academic advisor. If your advisor agrees, you can fill out a Request for Prerequisite Waiver form. If this request is approved, you will be allowed to sign up for the class even without fulfilling the prerequisites.

In case a class is full by the time you attempt to sign up for it, you can submit an Override Request (also known as the waitlist) form. The department will then try to increase the class size so that you can enroll in it. Keep in mind that similar procedures apply to overriding prerequisites for classes in other departments, such as math or physics.

Response: Carolina Core Overlay courses allow students to meet two Carolina Core component requirements in a single course. These overlay courses have at least one learning outcome from the Carolina Core's Communication (CMS), Information Literacy (INF), or Values, Ethics, and Social Responsibility (VSR) categories. However, keep in mind that a maximum of two overlays is allowed, and the total Carolina Core credit hours must still add up to a minimum of 31 hours. It's essential to check with your academic advisor to ensure the proper application of specific coursework towards your program of study and course selection and planning.

1. Identify the desired changes: Clearly define the modifications you want to make to your program learning outcomes. Ensure they align with your program's mission, goals, and competencies.

2. Consult stakeholders: Seek input from faculty, staff, students, alumni, and industry professionals to ensure the proposed changes are realistic, relevant, and beneficial.

3. Review and revise: Based on the feedback received, revise your program learning outcomes accordingly. Make sure they remain SMART (Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, and Time-framed).

4. Update supporting documents: Modify related program materials such as course syllabi, handbooks, and promotional materials to reflect the updated learning outcomes.

5. Notify affected parties: Inform all relevant parties, including accreditation bodies, about the changes made to the program learning outcomes.

Response: To determine if a curriculum change proposal is needed for making a change in the Bulletin, consider the following:

1. Noncurricular information, such as faculty listings, contact information, or college or departmental descriptive text, can be updated without a proposal by contacting the Office of the University Registrar on the Columbia Campus.

2. Any material pertaining to course descriptions or curriculum changes must have the approval of the Faculty Senate, Graduate Council, Board of Trustees, and/or S.C. Commission on Higher Education before it can be published in the bulletins. This typically involves submitting a curriculum change proposal through the Academic Programs Proposal System (APPS).

3. If you are unsure whether a change requires a proposal, consult the Graduate School's guidelines on submitting a proposal or contact the Office of the University Registrar for assistance.

Response: To propose a course action, follow these steps:
1. Determine if you want to create a new course, change an existing course, or terminate a course.
2. Gather all necessary information and materials for the type of course action you wish to propose.
3. Prepare a proposal using the APPS system, including any required justifications, Carolina Core information, and syllabi.
4. Submit your proposal to the appropriate faculty governance committees for review and approval. These committees may request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns.
5. Wait for approval from the Faculty Senate or Graduate Council.
For creating or changing a Carolina Core course, additional information and approval are needed from the Carolina Core Committee.
Keep in mind that course actions must comply with the University's academic expectations and utilize existing resources effectively.

2024-12-12 03:48:45,393 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: The amount of time required for a proposal to receive all levels of approval depends on several factors, including the complexity of the proposal, the timeliness of responses from collaborators, and the review process within the college and the Office of Research. Generally, if a proposal is submitted seven business days before the sponsor deadline, as per Arnold School of Public Health requirements, there should be enough time for it to undergo all necessary reviews and approvals. However, unforeseen circumstances might occasionally cause delays. It's essential to plan ahead, communicate effectively with all involved parties, and closely monitor the progress of your proposal throughout the approval process.

Response: Critical courses on the major maps refer to essential courses that need to be completed within a specific program of study. These courses are typically fundamental or foundational classes that build the basis for understanding the subject matter in later stages of the program. They might also include courses that are prerequisites for other classes or have requirements that need to be met before progressing further in the program. It is important to note that while major maps suggest a sequence of courses, it is always best to consult an academic advisor for personalized guidance regarding course selection and planning.

Response: Major maps are resources provided by the University of South Carolina to help guide students in their chosen field of study. They offer a suggested sequence of courses required for a specific program, ensuring a clear path to graduation. However, it's essential to remember that these are only recommendations; students should consult with their academic advisors for assistance in applying coursework to their programs and planning for future semesters. Additionally, major maps do not cover all possible scenarios or individual circumstances, so flexibility and communication with academic advisors are key to success.

Response: A cross-listed course at the University of South Carolina (USC) requires certain elements to be included in its proposal. Firstly, the course title in the proposal must match that in the syllabus. The syllabus should also mention the instructor's name along with the course meeting days, times, and location (or equivalent). The bulletin description in the proposal should correspond to the one in the syllabus.

Cross-listed courses may have pre- or co-requisites; these should be included in the syllabus and match those in the proposal. For special topics and independent studies, which might offer variable credits and be repeatable, the proposal needs to specify the range of hours, the number of times the course can be taken for credit, and the maximum number of credit hours that can be applied to the degree.

The syllabus should contain "Learning Outcomes," using that precise term. These outcomes should describe significant and essential learning that students will accomplish and can reliably demonstrate at the end of the course. They need to follow best practices, particularly employing action verbs that signify quantifiable or measurable actions. For 500/600 level courses, at least one learning outcome specific to graduate students should be included, connecting to an assignment designated for graduate students.

Response: A concentration refers to a specific field or area of focus within a student's degree program. At the University of South Carolina, a concentration typically consists of at least 18 credit hours of coursework related to that particular subject matter. These concentrations need to be approved by the Graduate Director and are officially recognized on a student's academic record. They allow students to specialize their studies and gain expertise in a particular discipline beyond the general requirements of their degree program. Examples of concentrations include Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM), Japanese within the Professional Masters of Business program, and many others.

Response: In the specific case of the Ph.D. in Marine Science program at the University of South Carolina, applicants can indeed apply to more than one concentration simultaneously. However, it's essential to note that once admitted into the program, students must choose only one concentration for their studies. This means that while you can express interest in multiple concentrations during the application process, you will eventually need to focus on just one of them for your degree requirements.

Response: Yes, you can choose specific courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program at the University of South Carolina. The Carolina Core consists of required courses with uniform learning outcomes that apply to all students, regardless of their major. While there are certain prescribed courses within each category of the Carolina Core, you have the flexibility to select from a variety of approved options that best align with your interests and academic goals. It's essential to review the list of courses satisfying Carolina Core requirements on the university's website and consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're making the most informed decisions for your educational journey. Keep in mind that courses used to satisfy Carolina Core requirements may not also be used to fulfill minor requirements.

2024-12-12 03:50:52,284 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: When making changes to a cross-listed course, it is essential to consider how these alterations may impact any associated cross-listed courses. However, whether all changes directly affect the cross-listed courses depends on the nature of the modifications. For instance, if there are adjustments to prerequisites, corequisites, or cross-listings themselves, then those changes will undoubtedly influence the connected courses. On the other hand, minor edits to the course description without affecting the course content, learning objectives, or assessment methods might not necessarily impact the cross-listed courses.

In terms of syllabi submission for cross-listed courses, it is required when introducing new courses or significantly changing course descriptions, Carolina Core or GLD designations, or delivery modes to over 50% online. This policy ensures that any substantial modifications undergo thorough examination and approval before implementation.

Lastly, regarding course bulletin descriptions and cross-listing submissions, it is crucial to ensure that all cross-listed courses have been uploaded timely and their bulletin descriptions are identical. This consistency facilitates a smooth review process and helps maintain the integrity of the academic offerings at the University of South Carolina.

2024-12-12 03:50:52,918 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: No, prerequisites do not necessarily have to be enforced in Banner during registration. However, it's essential to ensure that you meet all the prerequisites of the courses you intend to take. This is because Banner may prevent you from registering if you haven't satisfied the necessary prerequisites.

If you find yourself in a situation where you don't meet the prerequisites for a specific course, there might still be an opportunity to request an override. To learn more about overrides and their corresponding forms, consult the appropriate resources provided by the University of South Carolina.

Ultimately, discussing your concerns with your academic advisor is highly recommended. They can assess your situation and guide you through the process of obtaining a prerequisite waiver or override if needed.

2024-12-12 03:50:53,555 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: Carolina Core Overlay courses are a unique type of course at the University of South Carolina that allows students to fulfill multiple requirements with just one class. These overlays focus on developing essential skills such as public speaking and information literacy, making them particularly valuable for students pursuing various disciplines.

When taking an Overlay course, students have the opportunity to meet two requirements within a single course – but at least one of these overlays must stand alone and not be used to satisfy other parts of the Carolina Core. It's important to consult your specific major checklist or consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're selecting the right Overlay courses to meet your degree requirements.

To give you an idea of what to look for, approved Carolina Core Overlay courses should address specific learning outcomes from the Carolina Core, such as those related to Communication Skills (CMS), Information Literacy (INF), or Values, Ethics, and Social Responsibility (VSR). Additionally, the college or department responsible for offering the course should demonstrate expertise in the content area associated with the learning outcome.

For example, if a student takes HIST 108, it can serve as both a Non-US History course and a VSR overlay, helping them progress toward their graduation goals. By understanding how Carolina Core Overlay courses work, students like you can make informed decisions about which classes will best support your academic success!

Response: To change your program learning outcomes at the University of South Carolina, follow these steps:

1. Log into APPS (Academic Program Planning System) using your USC credentials.
2. Navigate to the "Program Learning Outcomes" section for your specific program.
3. Carefully review the existing learning outcomes, ensuring they remain clear, simple, and measurable.
4. Make necessary adjustments or additions to the learning outcomes, keeping in mind that they should align with your course content and reflect the desired student competencies upon completion of the program.
5. Save your changes and submit them for approval through the appropriate channels within the university. This may involve obtaining approval from department chairs, deans, or other university officials.
6. Keep track of your submitted changes and monitor their progress until they are officially approved and implemented.

Remember that learning outcomes should be reviewed and adjusted periodically as you become more familiar with students' abilities and changing academic expectations. Always strive to create learning outcomes that are relevant, current, and aligned with best practices in higher education.

Response: A curriculum change proposal is typically required when making significant modifications to a course or program of study. However, non-curricular information such as faculty listings, contact information, and college or departmental descriptive text can be updated directly by contacting the Office of the University Registrar. For minor updates or corrections to course descriptions, you might not need a full curriculum change proposal; instead, you could reach out to the appropriate university committee for guidance. If you're unsure whether your intended changes require a curriculum change proposal, it would be best to consult with the Curriculum Committee or an academic advisor at the University of South Carolina.

Response: To propose a program action at the University of South Carolina, you should first familiarize yourself with the goals and objectives of your specific program. Once you have identified an area for improvement or change, consider discussing your ideas with fellow students, faculty advisors, or other relevant stakeholders. This can help refine your proposal and gather support from those directly affected by the proposed action.

Next, draft a clear and concise proposal outlining the issue, your suggested solution, and any anticipated benefits or challenges. Be sure to include any necessary data or research to support your claims. Submit your proposal to the appropriate administrator or committee within your program or department, typically through a designated process or channel.

Keep in mind that successful program actions often involve collaboration, communication, and compromise between various parties. Stay open to feedback and willing to adjust your proposal as needed to ensure its alignment with the overall mission and values of the University of South Carolina.

Response: The time it takes for a proposal to receive all levels of approval can vary but typically may take several months. After submission, the proposal undergoes review by curriculum committees during the second week of each month. Once reviewed, it moves forward for a funding decision which can take six to nine months. Additionally, required approvals as outlined in the guidelines may also contribute to this timeline. Please note that you'll be notified within 10 business days whether or not you have been approved. For specific questions regarding the approval process, feel free to contact Wanda Barr at (803) 777-1875 or wandab@mailbox.sc.edu.

Response: If you are pursuing a degree in Business Administration at USC, changing your concentration will only affect the specific area of study you choose to specialize in. The seven concentration options include Accounting, Finance, Management, Marketing, Real Estate, Supply Chain Management, and Entrepreneurship. Each concentration has its unique course requirements and focuses on different aspects of business administration. However, if you're in the Master of Arts in Teaching program with three concentration options, changing your concentration would alter your entire program's focus. In this case, the three concentrations are Elementary Education, Middle Level Education, or Secondary Education. Please let me know if you need more information about either of these programs!

Response: In this context, critical courses on major maps refer to essential courses within a specific program of study that must be completed as part of the degree requirements. They typically form the foundation of the discipline and provide students with fundamental knowledge and skills necessary for success in their chosen field. Critical courses may vary depending on the major, so it's essential to consult the appropriate major map for detailed information on these courses. Keep in mind that while major maps offer a suggested sequence of courses, consulting an academic advisor can help clarify the application of specific coursework to a program of study and provide guidance on course selection and planning for future semesters.

Response: A major map at the University of South Carolina is a layout of required courses in a specific program of study, outlining critical courses and suggesting course sequences to help ensure a clear path to graduation. These maps serve as a guide for students pursuing their chosen field and are only a suggested or recommended sequence of courses required in the program. It is essential to consult an academic advisor for assistance in applying specific coursework to the program, as well as guidance on course selection and planning for future semesters. Additionally, all changes must be registered with the College Academic Affairs and Advising Office.

Response: A cross-listed course at the University of South Carolina (USC) refers to a single course that is offered by two or more departments with different prefixes but identical content, credit hours, and learning objectives. In this case, the requirements for a cross-listed course will depend on the specific department offering the course as its prerequisites. However, generally, if a student satisfies the prerequisites for one of the cross-listed courses, they are considered to meet the requirements for all other cross-listed versions of that course. For example, if a student meets the prerequisites for HIST 301, they would also satisfy the prerequisites for HUM 301 if it is cross-listed with HIST 301.

Response: At the University of South Carolina - Columbia, there isn't a strict requirement for a syllabus as it may vary depending on the course or instructor. However, a well-constructed syllabus typically outlines what is to be learned, how learning will occur, and how learning will be evaluated. Additionally, you might receive an email with specific details about what should be included in your syllabus. Ultimately, the syllabus serves as a crucial guide for students throughout the course, establishing expectations, standards, and overall structure.

2024-12-12 03:51:00,460 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: A cognate is a cluster of advanced-level courses (typically 12 credits) that relate to your major but aren't directly a part of it. For example, if you're studying Marine Science, Environmental Science, or Environmental Studies, you don't need a cognate. However, if you're studying Geological Sciences, you will need one. A cognate allows you to explore topics related to your major in greater depth, providing an opportunity to tailor your studies to your interests and career goals. It will appear on your academic transcript but not on your diploma. The specific courses that make up your cognate will be determined in consultation with your major advisor.

Response: A concentration is a specialized set of courses within a major field of study, allowing students to focus on specific areas of interest. It provides an opportunity to gain in-depth knowledge and skills in a particular subject. In the context of the University of South Carolina, concentrations can be added to your degree plan by consulting with your academic advisor. For instance, if you're studying physics and wish to concentrate on a particular aspect, you would need to discuss this with your advisor, who will then add the concentration to your profile. However, not all majors require or offer concentrations; for example, the B.S. in Physics does not have one.

Response: An integrative course is an upper-division course that incorporates one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core into the curriculum of a student's major. These courses aim to integrate foundational skills or knowledge from the Core into higher-level classes, allowing for increased awareness and attention to these skills throughout the student's academic journey.

Integrative learning goes beyond merely experiencing the material; it involves learning from the experience and connecting it to academic study. The final goal is applying the learned concepts to problem-solving and decision-making processes.

In the context of the University of South Carolina, integrative courses may include reflections, analysis of values, ethics, and social responsibility within the specific discipline area, service-learning opportunities, internships, or other field experiences that encourage study, reflection, and social action. Once approved by the Faculty Senate, the integrative course will be recorded in Degree Works.

Response: Progression requirements refer to the minimum criteria that students must meet to continue advancing in their academic programs at the University of South Carolina (USC). These requirements typically include maintaining a certain GPA, successfully completing specific courses, and fulfilling any program-specific progression requirements as outlined in each department's section of the USC bulletin. Additionally, some programs may have lab-designated progression courses that students need to pass. It is important to note that these requirements can be subject to change, and students should consult their academic advisors or the relevant department for the most up-to-date information regarding their progression requirements.

Response: The Carolina Core is a set of foundational courses at the University of South Carolina (USC) designed to ensure students gain essential skills and knowledge during their undergraduate education. These courses cover various disciplines, including English, mathematics, natural sciences, social sciences, and foreign languages. The Carolina Core aims to provide a well-rounded academic experience, fostering critical thinking, effective communication, and global awareness among USC students. More specific details about the Carolina Core can be found within the AIU, GHS US, or other relevant course codes you mentioned; however, I don't have direct access to those particular course details. For complete information, I recommend visiting the USC website or contacting the university directly.

Response: The difference between prerequisites and restrictions lies in their impact on course enrollment. A prerequisite refers to specific academic requirements or qualifications that a student must meet before enrolling in a particular course. These requirements ensure that students have the necessary background knowledge or skills to succeed in the class. On the other hand, restrictions limit enrollment based on factors other than academic preparedness, such as major, class standing, or enrollment status (e.g., full-time vs. part-time). Restrictions help manage course capacity and maintain balance among different student populations.

Response: An undergraduate degree program at the University of South Carolina typically involves completing all required coursework within the chosen major or field of study. This can be done through traditional on-campus classes, online courses, or a combination of both, depending on what format best suits the student's needs and schedule. Students should consult the Undergraduate Bulletin (<http://bulletin.sc.edu/>) for specific degree requirements, course descriptions, and academic regulations. It's essential to complete all necessary coursework and meet all requirements set forth by the university to earn the desired undergraduate degree.

Response: The process for course actions at the University of South Carolina involves creating an Action Plan when repeating a course. This plan outlines specific goals, actions, and criteria that must be met in order to progress. In the College of Education, students may repeat one course they received an unsatisfactory grade in, but this opportunity is limited to once per course.

For transfer courses, there is a separate approval process. The details of this process can vary depending on the specific circumstances, so it's best to consult with an academic advisor or other appropriate university official for guidance. They can help ensure that the transfer courses align with your degree requirements and are accepted by the university.

In general, it's important to stay proactive and engaged in your academic journey, keeping open lines of communication with your academic advisors and other university resources. By doing so, you can better navigate the course action process and make the most of your educational experience at USC.

2024-12-12 03:51:08,589 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: Cross-listed courses typically require additional proposals when there is a significant change in course description, a shift in Carolina Core or GLD designation, or an alteration in delivery mode to over 50% online. In these cases, submitting a full proposal with a corresponding syllabus would be necessary for the review process. However, if none of these changes apply, then only letters of concurrence from all involved units might suffice for the cross-listing. Kindly ensure that you are familiar with USC's guidelines and requirements before proceeding with the submission.

Response: A syllabus is typically not required for a proposal, as it is usually an outline or summary of what will be covered in a course or project. However, if the proposal is for a specific course, such as those numbered 500-600 level courses, a detailed syllabus would need to be provided before or during the first class session. This syllabus should include information about course objectives, assignments, grading criteria, and expectations for both undergraduate and graduate students. It is essential to ensure that all graduate students meet the requirements for graduate credit when providing a syllabus for a course proposal.

Response: If you need to request a correction for DegreeWorks, it is best to first contact your academic advisor. They can help assess whether the issue requires an update in DegreeWorks or if it can be resolved through other means. Keep in mind that during peak registration times, there might be a slight delay in getting a response from your advisor. While DegreeWorks is a useful tool for tracking progress towards graduation, it is not considered the official record of your degree requirements. Therefore, corrections should typically be made by working with your advisor instead of contacting the Registrar directly.

Response: Faculty members should be aware of DegreeWorks because it plays a crucial role in tracking students' progress towards their degrees. By understanding how DegreeWorks works, faculty can better advise students on course selection and academic planning. Furthermore, since the College of Arts and Sciences collaborates with the Registrar’s office to ensure DegreeWorks' efficiency, faculty may also contribute to refining this tool and enhancing its functionality for the benefit of all students. Overall, familiarity with DegreeWorks allows faculty to support students more effectively in achieving their academic goals at the University of South Carolina.

2024-12-12 03:51:14,812 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: In general, whether or not your proposal requires a letter of concurrence depends on the specific guidelines provided by the funding agency. It is essential to carefully review their instructions and requirements. However, since you mentioned submitting a Letter of Intent instead of a full proposal, it is unlikely that a letter of concurrence would be necessary at this stage. Nevertheless, I recommend checking with your Sponsored Awards Management (SAM) representative at the University of South Carolina (USC) for clarification regarding your specific situation. They can provide guidance tailored to the funding opportunity and ensure compliance with USC policies.

2024-12-12 03:51:15,442 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: At the University of South Carolina (USC), when you submit an external proposal, it needs to go through an internal approval process. Once you create and save a new proposal in USCeRA, you should allow at least three business days for your unit head and dean's office to review it before the sponsor's due date. They might request corrections if they have questions. The proposal requires endorsement/approval from the unit chair or director. Please note that this internal approval process is separate from any external approvals required by the sponsor.

Response: The drop/add/withdrawal (W) dates refer to specific deadlines within each academic semester at the University of South Carolina (USC). These dates impact how course changes affect tuition and fees, as well as textbook charges. Let me break down what each term means:

- **Drop:** This is the deadline for dropping a course without it appearing on your transcript. If you drop a course before this date, you will receive a full refund of tuition and fees, as well as any applicable textbook charges.

- **Add:** This is the deadline to add a new course to your schedule. After this date, you cannot add any additional courses for the semester.

- **Withdrawal (W):** This is the last day to withdraw from a course with a grade of 'W' on your transcript. Withdrawing after the drop date but before the withdrawal date will result in a partial refund of tuition and fees, but textbook charges will not be refunded.

To sum up, whether you get money back for dropped classes depends on the timing of the drop relative to the established drop/add/withdrawal dates for the given semester. To find the exact dates for the current or upcoming semesters, please consult the [USC Drop/Add/Refund Dates](https://banner.onecarolina.sc.edu/BannerExtensibility/customPage/page/z_spg_codes-dates?mepCode=COL) webpage.

Response: Failing a class can impact your academic standing at the University of South Carolina. It may result in a lower grade point average (GPA) and could potentially place you on academic probation if your cumulative GPA falls below certain thresholds. However, it's important to remember that one failed class does not necessarily mean you will be dismissed from the university.

If you find yourself failing a class, consider speaking with your professor to discuss possible solutions or strategies for improving your performance. You might also want to reach out to an academic advisor who can help guide you through this situation and provide resources such as tutoring services or study groups.

Remember, handling a failed class early on can prevent further academic difficulties down the road. Stay proactive, seek assistance when needed, and continue working diligently towards achieving your academic goals at USC.

Response: If you find yourself unable to enroll in a required course due to it being full, there are several steps you can take. Firstly, regularly check the registration system as spots may become available due to other students dropping or switching classes. Secondly, consider reaching out to the academic department offering the course to inquire about possible options such as overloading the class or waiting lists. Lastly, if these methods prove unsuccessful, consult with your academic advisor who can help explore alternative courses that fulfill similar requirements. Remember, it's essential to address this issue promptly to ensure timely progress towards your degree.

Response: I'm sorry to hear that you won't be able to attend the event. If you have already registered, it's important to cancel your registration as soon as possible so that we can offer your spot to another prospective family. You can do this by clicking on the cancellation link provided in your confirmation email or by contacting us directly at 803-777-0169. This way, you can still show your support and pride for the University of South Carolina community even if you're unable to join us in person. Thank you for understanding!

This email will include instructions on how to obtain your tickets. If you haven't received an email by then, it's recommended to check your spam folder or contact the appropriate office to ensure your application was processed correctly. Remember, ticketing updates are made daily, usually in the afternoon.

Response: It seems like the context provides two different scenarios for ticket allocation. If you're attending a Baccalaureate, Masters, or Professional Commencement Ceremony at the University of South Carolina, you will receive up to five tickets for your guests. On the other hand, if you order individual subscriptions, you will receive six tickets per subscription to use as desired throughout the season. To determine which situation applies to your case, please provide more details about the specific event or subscription you're referring to.

Response: Dear user,

Based on the provided context, dual degree graduates can choose to sit with the college of their preference. However, there might be certain regulations specific to each dual degree program that could affect this decision. It is essential for students to consult the Dual Degree Program guidelines and discuss their choices with their respective academic advisors. This way, they can ensure they meet all degree requirements and make informed decisions regarding their academic careers at the University of South Carolina.

Best regards,
Your USC Chatbot

Response: To ensure your name is pronounced correctly during the University of South Carolina commencement ceremonies, you should follow these steps:
1. Watch out for emails from Marching Order, a third-party vendor managing name pronunciations for the event.
2. Record your name as you would like it to be pronounced on their portal before the deadline.
3. If your name is not spelled correctly on your card, you can find blank cards at the ceremony to write it down properly.
4. If your name is hard to pronounce, consider writing it phonetically on the card or whispering it to the reader as you approach.

Response: At the University of South Carolina, we currently offer two interdisciplinary majors and six area minors. While I cannot provide specific details about upcoming announcements regarding new majors, minors, or concentrations, it is common for universities to regularly review and update their academic programs to meet the evolving needs of students and society.

Response: It seems like your degree status is still listed as pending because the final review process has not been completed yet. This is normal and can take some time after graduation. To check the current status of your degree, you can log into my.sc.edu and view your academic transcript. Once your degree is listed as awarded on your transcript, you can then proceed with submitting your transcript order for your diploma. The mailing time for diplomas may vary, so keep an eye on your email for updates regarding its delivery.

Response: Online students at the University of South Carolina are not required to provide immunization records when initially enrolling; however, they can choose to submit them to lift any potential immunization holds. If you decide to submit your immunization records, you won't need to resubmit them for future semesters. However, if you prefer not to submit your records, you must fill out the Distance Learner Exemption Form every semester to avoid having an immunization hold. Keep in mind that some programs with clinical components may still require official immunization records regardless of whether you're studying online or on campus.

Obtaining a library card is simple – you will immediately receive a card number upon request, allowing you to take advantage of these valuable resources.

Response: Online exams at the University of South Carolina are administered using WebCt, which allows for oral, written, and practical questions. To ensure a smooth experience, consider submitting a request through the Self-Service Portal or consulting the online Knowledge Base. Additionally, take advantage of the opportunity to complete a practice exam to familiarize yourself with the online testing environment. Remember, if you encounter any issues or need assistance, you can chat with a Service Desk technician during their available hours. In order to maintain academic integrity, it's essential to create an effective testing environment at home and follow guidelines provided by email and the exam instructions. As an alternative to traditional high-stakes exams, you might also expect shorter, more frequent assessments throughout the course.

Response: An "overload" generally refers to a situation where someone is taking on more work or responsibility than usual. In the context provided, an overload seems to be related to academic coursework, specifically when a student requests to take on additional sections or classes beyond their regular course load. The reasons for an overload may vary, but it could be due to factors such as scheduling conflicts, specific course requirements, or other academic needs. Keep in mind that if you're considering requesting an overload, there might be policies and procedures in place at the University of South Carolina that you should follow, so it's best to consult with the appropriate offices or staff members for guidance.

Response: The pass/fail option at the University of South Carolina allows students to take certain courses without receiving a traditional letter grade (A-F). Instead, they will receive either a "pass" or "fail" designation on their transcript. This can help reduce academic pressure and encourage exploration of new subjects. However, it's essential to note that some programs may have restrictions on how many classes can be taken pass/fail or which specific courses are eligible for this grading option. Students should consult with their academic advisor before choosing the pass/fail grading basis for any course.

Response: Yes, you can take courses at another institution during the summer as long as you meet certain requirements. You must be in good standing at your current institution, eligible to return, and have institutional permission to enroll in a specific course. The University of South Carolina (USC) also offers hundreds of summer courses, many of which are available online. This means you can be enrolled full-time and still go home for the summer. Summer courses at USC are typically offered in June and July.

2024-12-12 03:51:58,332 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: A second major is an additional area of study that you can choose to pursue alongside your primary major. At the University of South Carolina's College of Arts and Sciences, if you decide to take a second major, you will need to fulfill all the collegiate requirements including general education courses and specific departmental requirements for both majors. In case your first and second major lead to different degrees, you must declare one as the official degree of record. A second major waives the cognate requirement but does not necessarily waive all special departmental requirements usually completed as part of the cognate. Upon graduation, the completion of a second major will be indicated on your official transcript. However, no notation for a second major will appear on the transcript for coursework completed after graduation.

Response: A second degree refers to when a student earns two distinct degrees from the University of South Carolina. This could involve applying for both degrees simultaneously or sequentially, resulting in two separate diplomas. Completing a second major does not automatically lead to a second degree; instead, it requires filing a separate degree application for each degree with the appropriate college or school. It's important to note that having two majors typically results in one diploma, while pursuing two separate degrees results in receiving two diplomas.

Response: I'm sorry to hear that you're facing challenges affecting your academic performance at the University of South Carolina. Here are some steps you can take when dealing with extenuating circumstances:

1. Document your situation: Gather any relevant documentation, such as medical records, police reports, or letters from professionals involved in your situation. This evidence will help support your request for accommodations.

2. Contact your professors: Reach out to your instructors as soon as possible to inform them about your circumstances and discuss potential solutions. They might offer alternatives like extensions, make-up assignments, or alternative assessments.

3. Seek assistance from Support Services: Utilize resources available through the University's Student Disability Resource Center (SDRC), Counseling and Psychiatry, or other relevant departments. These offices can provide guidance, accommodations, and additional support during difficult times.

4. Follow University policies: Make sure to adhere to the guidelines outlined in Rule 1 regarding academic dismissals due to failure to meet academic requirements. Familiarize yourself with the process and requirements for petitioning for exceptions.

5. Submit a petition: If your circumstances warrant it, consider submitting a petition to the Office of the Dean of Undergraduate Studies. Be prepared to present detailed information about your situation, supporting documentation, and a clear plan for improvement.

Remember, it's essential to communicate openly with your professors and seek help from university resources to address extenuating circumstances effectively. Good luck!

Response: In the context provided, the M.P.A. program offers an Emergency Management and Planning concentration which requires 9 credit hours. However, there is no mention of having multiple concentrations within a single program. It appears that only one concentration can be declared for this specific program. For further clarification, it would be best to consult the official program guidelines or contact the administration directly.

Response: Yes, when selecting courses for the Carolina Core, you can choose from a list of approved courses that fulfill each component's learning outcomes. Some majors may have prescribed courses for certain Carolina Core components, so it's essential to consult your academic advisor or refer to the academic bulletin for major-specific recommendations.

Response: Yes, when making changes to a cross-listed course, it affects all cross-listed courses associated with it. This includes updates to course descriptions, prerequisites, learning outcomes, and other aspects of the course syllabus. It's crucial to ensure that all cross-listed courses remain consistent and up-to-date to avoid confusion for students. Therefore, when proposing changes to a cross-listed course, keep in mind that these modifications will impact all related courses within the cross-listing.

2024-12-12 03:52:03,958 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: Yes, prerequisites generally must be enforced in Banner when signing up for classes at the University of South Carolina. This means that if you want to register for a specific course, you typically need to have completed the required prerequisites first. The purpose of this system is to ensure that students have the necessary background knowledge and skills to succeed in more advanced courses.

However, there may be some situations where prerequisites can be waived. For instance, if you believe you have the appropriate knowledge or experience despite not meeting the prerequisites, you can discuss this with your academic advisor. If your advisor agrees, you can fill out a Request for Prerequisite Waiver form. If this request is approved, you will be allowed to sign up for the class even without fulfilling the prerequisites.

In case a class is full by the time you attempt to sign up for it, you can submit an Override Request (also known as the waitlist) form. The department will then try to increase the class size so that you can enroll in it. Keep in mind that similar procedures apply to overriding prerequisites for classes in other departments, such as math or physics.

Response: Carolina Core Overlay courses allow students to meet two Carolina Core component requirements in a single course. These overlay courses have at least one learning outcome from the Carolina Core's Communication (CMS), Information Literacy (INF), or Values, Ethics, and Social Responsibility (VSR) categories. However, keep in mind that a maximum of two overlays is allowed, and the total Carolina Core credit hours must still add up to a minimum of 31 hours. It's essential to check with your academic advisor to ensure the proper application of specific coursework towards your program of study and course selection and planning.

Response: To change your program learning outcomes, follow these steps:

1. Identify the desired changes: Clearly define the modifications you want to make to your program learning outcomes. Ensure they align with your program's mission, goals, and competencies.

2. Consult stakeholders: Seek input from faculty, staff, students, alumni, and industry professionals to ensure the proposed changes are realistic, relevant, and beneficial.

3. Review and revise: Based on the feedback received, revise your program learning outcomes accordingly. Make sure they remain SMART (Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, and Time-framed).

4. Update supporting documents: Modify related program materials such as course syllabi, handbooks, and promotional materials to reflect the updated learning outcomes.

5. Notify affected parties: Inform all relevant parties, including accreditation bodies, about the changes made to the program learning outcomes.

6. Implementation and monitoring: Begin implementing the new learning outcomes in your curriculum. Regularly assess and update them based on ongoing evaluation and feedback.

Response: To determine if a curriculum change proposal is needed for making a change in the Bulletin, consider the following:

1. Noncurricular information, such as faculty listings, contact information, or college or departmental descriptive text, can be updated without a proposal by contacting the Office of the University Registrar on the Columbia Campus.

2. Any material pertaining to course descriptions or curriculum changes must have the approval of the Faculty Senate, Graduate Council, Board of Trustees, and/or S.C. Commission on Higher Education before it can be published in the bulletins. This typically involves submitting a curriculum change proposal through the Academic Programs Proposal System (APPS).

3. If you are unsure whether a change requires a proposal, consult the Graduate School's guidelines on submitting a proposal or contact the Office of the University Registrar for assistance.

Response: To propose a course action, follow these steps:
1. Determine if you want to create a new course, change an existing course, or terminate a course.
2. Gather all necessary information and materials for the type of course action you wish to propose.
3. Prepare a proposal using the APPS system, including any required justifications, Carolina Core information, and syllabi.
4. Submit your proposal to the appropriate faculty governance committees for review and approval. These committees may request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns.
5. Wait for approval from the Faculty Senate or Graduate Council.
For creating or changing a Carolina Core course, additional information and approval are needed from the Carolina Core Committee.
Keep in mind that course actions must comply with the University's academic expectations and utilize existing resources effectively.

Response: The amount of time required for a proposal to receive all levels of approval depends on several factors, including the complexity of the proposal, the timeliness of responses from collaborators, and the review process within the college and the Office of Research. Generally, if a proposal is submitted seven business days before the sponsor deadline, as per Arnold School of Public Health requirements, there should be enough time for it to undergo all necessary reviews and approvals. However, unforeseen circumstances might occasionally cause delays. It's essential to plan ahead, communicate effectively with all involved parties, and closely monitor the progress of your proposal throughout the approval process.

Response: Critical courses on the major maps refer to essential courses that need to be completed within a specific program of study. These courses are typically fundamental or foundational classes that build the basis for understanding the subject matter in later stages of the program. They might also include courses that are prerequisites for other classes or have requirements that need to be met before progressing further in the program. It is important to note that while major maps suggest a sequence of courses, it is always best to consult an academic advisor for personalized guidance regarding course selection and planning.

Response: Major maps are resources provided by the University of South Carolina to help guide students in their chosen field of study. They offer a suggested sequence of courses required for a specific program, ensuring a clear path to graduation. However, it's essential to remember that these are only recommendations; students should consult with their academic advisors for assistance in applying coursework to their programs and planning for future semesters. Additionally, major maps do not cover all possible scenarios or individual circumstances, so flexibility and communication with academic advisors are key to success.

Response: A cross-listed course at the University of South Carolina (USC) requires certain elements to be included in its proposal. Firstly, the course title in the proposal must match that in the syllabus. The syllabus should also mention the instructor's name along with the course meeting days, times, and location (or equivalent). The bulletin description in the proposal should correspond to the one in the syllabus.

Cross-listed courses may have pre- or co-requisites; these should be included in the syllabus and match those in the proposal. For special topics and independent studies, which might offer variable credits and be repeatable, the proposal needs to specify the range of hours, the number of times the course can be taken for credit, and the maximum number of credit hours that can be applied to the degree.

The syllabus should contain "Learning Outcomes," using that precise term. These outcomes should describe significant and essential learning that students will accomplish and can reliably demonstrate at the end of the course. They need to follow best practices, particularly employing action verbs that signify quantifiable or measurable actions. For 500/600 level courses, at least one learning outcome specific to graduate students should be included, connecting to an assignment designated for graduate students.

Response: A concentration refers to a specific field or area of focus within a student's degree program. At the University of South Carolina, a concentration typically consists of at least 18 credit hours of coursework related to that particular subject matter. These concentrations need to be approved by the Graduate Director and are officially recognized on a student's academic record. They allow students to specialize their studies and gain expertise in a particular discipline beyond the general requirements of their degree program. Examples of concentrations include Applied and Computational Mathematics (ACM), Japanese within the Professional Masters of Business program, and many others.

Response: At the University of South Carolina, course actions involve creating new courses, revising or editing existing ones, or eliminating them entirely. These processes require approval by various bodies within the university, including faculty governance committees, the Office of the Provost, and the Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. To propose a new course, change an existing one, or terminate a course, you can use APPS, the university's system for managing academic programs and courses. For more specific details regarding the process, it would be best to consult the "Creation and Revision of Academic Courses" policy provided in the context. Additionally, there are separate procedures for proposing Carolina Core courses and Integrative courses, which also require approval by the Carolina Core Committee and follow specific guidelines outlined in the context.

Response: Cross-listed courses typically require additional proposals when the proposed course involves a significant change in course description or delivery mode to >50% online. In such cases, both departments involved must submit separate proposals for the same course, each indicating the specific changes applicable to their respective programs. However, if the cross-listing only affects the course meeting days, times, and location, or if it is simply a letter of concurrence without any significant changes, then no additional proposals are required. Instead, a letter of concurrence from the other department confirming their agreement to the cross-listing would suffice.

Response: A syllabus is required for a proposal when submitting new courses or courses with significant changes in course description, Carolina Core or GLD designation, or delivery mode to over 50% online. This includes cases where pre- or co-requisites are added, or for special topics and independent studies courses that can be taken multiple times with varying credit hours. In these situations, the syllabus must include learning outcomes using the exact phrase "Learning Outcomes," describing significant and essential learning that students will achieve and can reliably demonstrate at the end of a course. For 500/600 level courses, ensure there is at least one learning outcome specific to graduate students, connecting to an assignment specific to them.

Response: The context provided does not include specific information about submission deadlines for the next Bulletin year at the University of South Carolina. However, it is generally recommended to check the academic calendar or the department's website for such information, as deadlines may vary depending on the program and type of proposal. Be sure to prepare and submit your proposal well in advance of the deadline to allow time for any unexpected issues or delays.

Response: The Academic Program Liaisons (APLs) are individuals appointed by their respective deans to serve as the primary source of information regarding academic program actions within their college, campus, or school. To find the APL for your specific college, I would recommend checking the table provided in the context. This table lists each college, school, or campus along with the corresponding APL name, phone number, and email address. Simply locate your college in the table and use the associated contact information to reach out to the appropriate APL.

Response: Faculty should be familiar with DegreeWorks because it helps them monitor students' progress towards degree completion. This web-based tool matches student record data with degree requirements, allowing both students and advisors to easily identify which courses meet degree requirements and which ones still need to be completed. By understanding how to use DegreeWorks, faculty can better assist students in planning future coursework and ensuring timely graduation.

2024-12-12 03:52:41,790 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: Your proposal may not necessarily require external approvals, as this depends on various factors such as the nature of the project, funding sources, and institutional policies. However, if your proposal involves multiple accounts or units from different departments or schools within the University of South Carolina, it is recommended to create separate budgets for each account. This simplifies tracking and collection of indirect costs when awards are made and projects are established.

In general, it's essential to consult with your departmental administrator or research office early in the proposal development process to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations and internal procedures. They can help determine whether external approvals are necessary for your specific situation. Remember, being proactive and well-informed about these matters can save time and effort during the submission and review stages.

Response: Each drop/add/w date refers to specific points in the semester when you can perform certain actions related to your class schedule and receive refunds for dropped classes. Here's what each term means:

- Drop/Add: This period allows you to add or drop classes without any penalties or grades being recorded. You can do this through Self Service Carolina during the specified period.

- Last day to change/drop a course without a grade of "W" being recorded: After this date, you can still drop a course, but a "W" grade will appear on your transcript, indicating that you withdrew from the class.

- Last day to drop a course or withdraw without a grade of "WF" being recorded: After this date, if you drop a course, you will receive a "WF" grade, which impacts your GPA negatively. However, there might still be financial implications; check the refund dates below for details.

- Last day to drop a course or withdraw without a penalty: This is the final date to drop a course without any penalties. After this date, you cannot drop any courses, and you will be responsible for paying for them.

Regarding refunds for dropped classes, here are the key dates you should know:

- Through [insert appropriate date]: 100% refund for dropping or complete withdrawal
- Through [insert appropriate date]: 70% refund for dropping a course or complete withdrawal
- Through [insert appropriate date]: 50% refund for dropping a course or complete withdrawal
- Through [insert appropriate date]: 20% refund for dropping a course or complete withdrawal

After the last refund date, you won't receive any money back for dropped classes. Keep in mind that these dates vary depending on the specific part of the term in which your class is scheduled. Check the Self Service Carolina website or consult with a school representative for exact dates applicable to your situation.

Response: If you lose your CarolinaCard, it is essential to report it missing as soon as possible. You can either contact the CarolinaCard office directly or visit the CarolinaCard Online portal, which is accessible 24/7 via MY.SC.EDU at my.sc.edu/carolinacard/. Until the university receives notification of the lost card, you remain responsible for any unauthorized usage. If you find your card later, you can reactivate it through the same portal, just like how you deactivated it.
The replacement fee for students is $35.00, while spouses need to pay $25.00 for a damaged card or $35.00 for a lost card.

Response: To find out when your finals are, I recommend checking your course syllabi first, as your professors should have provided specific dates and times for each final examination. If you cannot locate this information in your syllabi, consider reaching out to your professors directly or consulting your academic advisor for assistance. Additionally, the University of South Carolina's Student Success Center often provides resources and support during finals week, including review sessions and tutoring, so keep an eye on their website for further information and guidance.

Response: If you're having trouble getting into a required class, I recommend reaching out to the academic department offering the course directly. They might be able to help you find alternative options such as overrides, waitlists, or other sections. Also, consider meeting with your academic advisor to explore different paths towards fulfilling your degree requirements. Remember, patience and persistence are key during registration periods, as classes may fill up quickly.

Response: If you won't be able to attend an event you had planned to, it's important to let your student know as soon as possible so they can adjust their plans accordingly. You could also consider sending them a care package or some other form of support to show that you're still thinking of them even if you can't be there in person. Remember, there will be other opportunities to get involved on campus and show your pride for your student and the University of South Carolina.

Response: Dear user,

Thank you for reaching out with your question! Based on the provided context, dual degree graduates are not specified to sit with a particular college. They would typically sit with the college associated with their primary major or area of focus. However, it is essential to consult with an academic advisor or administrator for precise information, considering the unique nature of dual degree programs.

Best regards,

Response: To graduate with honors from the South Carolina Honors College, you must complete at least 45 credit hours of Honors College courses, including a minimum of 3 credit hours of senior thesis or project. These courses must include one course each in English, laboratory science, the history of civilization, analytical reasoning, the humanities, the social sciences, and an outside the classroom experience (Beyond the Classroom) such as undergraduate research, an Honors service learning course, study away, or an internship. You must also maintain a minimum GPA on a sliding scale that starts at 3.00 for first-year students and rises to 3.30 for seniors. Additionally, Honors College students must earn Honors course credits - 9 by the end of their first year, 18 after their sophomore year, and 27 after their junior year-to remain in good standing in the college.

Response: If you are a student graduating from the University of South Carolina and participating in the Bachelor, Master’s, or Professional commencement ceremony, you can ensure your name is pronounced correctly by following these steps:

1. Log in to the online portal using the instructions provided in the email you received after applying to graduate.
2. Record your name as you would like it pronounced, providing phonetic pronunciation if needed.

The portal has specific open and close dates, so make sure to complete this process before it closes. If you don't record your name, an announcer will do it based on professional judgment.

At the commencement ceremony, you will receive a barcoded name card. Bring this card with you when walking across the stage. A commencement marshal will collect it for scanning and announcing your name. Remember to wait for your name to be called before crossing the stage.

Response: Yes, the University of South Carolina (USC) offers various majors, minors, and concentrations across its colleges and schools. For instance, the College of Information and Communications provides several minors such as Advertising and Public Relations, Informatics, Mass Communications, Social Media and Mass Communications, Sports Media, and User Experience and Design. These minors can be paired with a wide range of majors to create a well-rounded academic experience. Additionally, some departments offer concentrations within majors, like the School of Journalism and Mass Communications' Sports Media Concentration. It would be best to check directly with the specific college or department for the most up-to-date and comprehensive list of available options.

Response: At USC athletics events, only clear bags are allowed due to the Clear Bag Policy. The dimensions of these bags should not exceed 4.5" by 6.5". Personal items such as coats, purses, bags, and other belongings can be stored securely in self-service lockers. For research purposes at Hollings Library, only pencils, paper, laptops, and cameras are permitted in the Smith Reading Room. Food and drinks are generally prohibited in the library.

As for Policy Handbags, they were created in response to the NFL and stadium officials announcing new rules banning all bags larger than 4.5” by 6.5”. This policy was implemented as a safety and security measure. More information about Policy Handbags can be found at https://policyhandbags.com/.

If you have checked that box, your diploma will show your last (family) name first, followed by your middle name or initial, and then your first name. Remember to double-check the spelling and accuracy of your name before submitting the form.

Response: To graduate with honors from the South Carolina Honors College, you must complete at least 45 credit hours of Honors College courses, including a minimum of 3 credit hours of senior thesis or project. These courses must include one course each in English, laboratory science, the history of civilization, analytical reasoning, the humanities, the social sciences, and an outside the classroom experience (Beyond the Classroom) such as undergraduate research, an Honors service learning course, study away, or an internship. You must also maintain a minimum GPA on a sliding scale that starts at 3.00 for first-year students and rises to 3.30 for seniors. Additionally, Honors College students must earn Honors course credits - 9 by the end of their first year, 18 after their sophomore year, and 27 after their junior year-to remain in good standing in the college.

Response: To find textbook information for your online course, first check if there's a designated section in the course management system where the textbook details are provided. If not, you can usually find this information on the university's bookstore website, such as the Barnes & Noble @ USC Bookstore. You can search for your course materials by selecting the term, department, and course number. Keep in mind that some instructors might choose alternative textbooks or openly accessible resources, so it's essential to double-check the syllabus or contact the instructor for confirmation.

Regarding music, since the context doesn't provide specific information about it, I cannot directly relate it to finding textbook information. However, if you're looking for open educational resources (OER) related to music or music education, there are various sources available online. Some popular platforms include the Open Music Theory Textbook, Musopen, and the Internet Archive's Live Music Archive. These resources offer free and open access to music-related content, which could potentially be used as supplementary materials for your online course.

Response: Online students are not required to submit immunization records unless they plan to visit the campus for any reason. It is essential to comply with immunization requirements if they intend to take advantage of on-campus resources or activities. Otherwise, online students can complete their studies without submitting immunization records.

Response: The University of South Carolina (USC) offers various resources to help students with research. First, if you're interested in research, consider contacting faculty members directly via email or visiting their offices. You can learn about their research areas and determine if there's a match with your interests. You may use the faculty research database to find faculty members with similar research interests: <https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/undergraduate_research/get-started/faculty_research_database/index.php>.

Moreover, the Office of Undergraduate Research provides individual consultations to guide you through the process of starting research. They can help you clarify your research interests, find a faculty mentor, and discuss the next steps. To schedule a consultation, visit sc.campus.eab.com and follow the instructions provided in the context.

Lastly, you can attend a Getting Started in Research Workshop led by OUR student advisors. These workshops cover understanding research interests, navigating the OUR Faculty Research Database, and creating a roadmap for research engagement. Visit the following link to learn more about the workshop offerings: <https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/undergraduate_research/get-started/workshops/index.php>.

Response: To re-enroll in a course from which you have been dropped due to non-payment, you will need to pay your account balance in full or enroll in the University’s payment plan option by the drop/add date. If you have been dropped for non-payment and re-enroll in classes after the payment deadline, students and those registering for the first time will need to ensure their account balance is paid off. 

If you wish to re-enroll after the drop/add date, you will need to submit a Registration Exception Form (AS-199) to the Registrar’s Office for processing. Additionally, a $75 reinstatement fee will be charged to your account. Make sure to pay the balance within 24 hours of being re-enrolled in your courses to avoid being dropped again.

If your waiver request is denied, you can submit an appeal to the University Health Services' Health Insurance Assistance Office. Keep in mind that there are deadlines for waiving the fee, so make sure to check the website for the most up-to-date information regarding these deadlines.

Response: To change your major within the College of Arts and Sciences, you can sign up for a new major session or make an exploratory advising appointment with the University Advising Center. If you want to change majors to another college at the University, you must be accepted by that college. You can investigate next steps with help from the Exploratory Advising team.

If you are changing majors within your current college or school, the process depends upon which college or school you’re in. For example, if you want to change majors within the College of Arts and Sciences, you may make an appointment with an Exploratory Advisor or visit the Office of Undergraduate Studies in Flinn Hall. However, if you are in a college or school other than the College of Arts and Sciences or the College of Information and Communications, you should meet with your assigned academic advisor for next steps on switching your major.

Response: To get an override into a class that is already full, you should contact the department offering the course. They are responsible for granting overrides, and you can reach out to them directly to request one. Once you receive an override or special permission, you can then complete a registration transaction through the Self Service Carolina system. Keep in mind that departments do not complete registration transactions for students.

Response: An overload refers to taking more than the normal course load at the University of South Carolina (USC). The normal course load is typically between 15-18 credit hours per semester. An overload means taking more than 18 credit hours, which requires special permission from the Office of Undergraduate Studies. This permission is usually granted to students who have maintained a GPA of 3.0 or better on a minimum of 12 hours taken on a non-pass/fail basis in the previous full semester.

Response: The pass/fail option is a unique feature of the University of South Carolina's grading system. This option allows students to take certain courses outside their major area of study on a pass/fail basis, meaning they receive either a satisfactory (S) or unsatisfactory (U) grade instead of traditional letter grades. Courses taken with the pass/fail option do not impact a student's grade point average. However, it's essential to follow specific guidelines when utilizing the pass/fail grading system at the University of South Carolina, considering its importance in the overall grading policy?

Response: A second major refers to adding an additional field of study to your primary major. At the University of South Carolina, if you choose to pursue a second major, it must be in a different field than your primary major, and you must fulfill all the major courses and any prescribed courses specific to that major. Typically, a second major shares some common courses with your primary major, such as those required by the Carolina Core, College requirements, or Program requirements. However, no course may satisfy both major and minor requirements. The minor or second major may not be from fields closely aligned to data science theory, and at least half of the courses in the minor must be completed in residence at the University.

Response: A second degree refers to completing the major requirements for a second field of study in addition to your primary major. At the University of South Carolina, you can declare a second degree within the College of Arts and Sciences or the School of Music (Bachelor of Arts track only). This allows you to earn two distinct degrees from USC. To pursue a second degree, you must complete all collegiate requirements as well as the major requirements for both fields of study. Note that one major must be designated as the official degree of record if they belong to different programs (e.g., Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Science). To request a second degree, complete a Curriculum Change Form at go.sc.edu/CASforms through the Office of Undergraduate Studies.

Response: If you are concerned about a USC student's well-being, there are several resources available to help. First, consider reaching out to the Student Care and Outreach Team at 803-777-4193 for a consultation. They are a group of caring professionals dedicated to student success and well-being, and their primary goal is to ensure that the student involved gains the necessary resources to remain successful academically and personally at USC.

For specific concerns such as student substance abuse, student-on-student interpersonal violence, or faculty-on-student or staff-on-student incidents, there are specialized reporting mechanisms and resources available. Visit the Student Health and Well-Being website for detailed information on how to report these concerns.

Lastly, remember to prioritize your own well-being and seek support for yourself if needed. Counseling and Psychiatry services are available to all USC students, providing a safe space to talk and receive professional assistance.

Response: Yes, you can choose specific courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program. The Carolina Core is a set of requirements that students across the University of South Carolina have to complete as part of their program of study. The Carolina Core is made up of 10 core components, each with learning outcome and credit hour requirements.

For example, if you are studying in the College of Arts and Sciences, you will have to take at least one Additional Humanities class, one Founding Documents course, and one U.S. History/Non-U.S. History class, among others. These courses will count towards your Carolina Core requirements as well as your College Requirements.

To find the entire list of Carolina Core applicable courses, as well as the requirements that they fulfill, you can refer to the most recent academic bulletin. Also, prototypical syllabi are available for all Carolina Core courses, which illustrate options for tailoring the syllabi for individual classes.

Keep in mind that your advisor can help guide you in choosing the right courses for your program and the Carolina Core.

Response: When making changes to a cross-listed course, it typically affects all cross-listed courses as well since these courses share the same curriculum. However, if the changes only concern specific aspects such as pre-/co-requisites or variable credit hours involving another department/program, a letter of concurrence may be required. It is essential to ensure that all necessary approvals and adjustments are completed before implementing any modifications to maintain consistency across the cross-listed courses.

Response: Carolina Core Overlay courses allow you to meet two learning outcomes with a single course, which helps reduce the overall number of credit hours needed to complete the Carolina Core requirements. These courses are specially designated to cover material from two different learning outcomes. It's essential to note that the maximum number of overlays you can use to fulfill the Carolina Core requirements is two. The context information provides various links to the Carolina Core courses, requirements, and overlay-eligible courses, which could be useful to consult for more details on specific overlay courses.

Response: To change your program learning outcomes, you should follow these steps:

1. Review the current learning outcomes and identify areas that need improvement or modification.
2. Consult with important stakeholders, including university administration, faculty, students, alumni, and community members, to ensure agreement on the changes.
3. Ensure the learning outcomes are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, and Time-Framed.
4. Align the program learning outcomes with the institution's mission, goals, and Carolina Core learning outcomes.
5. Update the program syllabi and course learning outcomes to reflect the changes in program learning outcomes.
6. Communicate the changes to all relevant parties, including current and prospective students, faculty, and staff.
7. Monitor the effectiveness of the new learning outcomes and make adjustments as needed.

Keep in mind that changing program learning outcomes might require approval from the university administration or other governing bodies. Be prepared to provide a rationale for the changes and demonstrate how they will benefit students and the program.

Response: To determine whether you need a curriculum change proposal for making changes in the Bulletin, consult the policies and procedures provided by the University of South Carolina. According to these documents, any changes to the curriculum, such as new course proposals or alterations to existing undergraduate courses, should be presented to the Curriculum Committee for consideration. The Committee will then recommend the changes to the entire faculty at the next scheduled faculty meeting. If approved, the proposal will be forwarded to the School’s Director, who is responsible for sending it to the appropriate University committee.

Changes to graduate curricular programs and courses also require proposals, which must be submitted through the Office of Academic Programs and reviewed by the Graduate Council or Graduate School Administration. Additionally, proposing new Carolina Core courses or changes to previously approved courses involves specific procedures and guidelines.

In general, it's essential to follow the proper channels and adhere to the University's policies and procedures when making changes to the Bulletin. Consulting with the head of your academic unit and the Academic Program Liaison (APL) in your college or school can provide valuable guidance throughout the process.

Response: To propose a course action at the University of South Carolina, follow these steps:

1. Identify the type of course action you want to propose: new course, change to an existing course, or termination of a course.

2. Prepare your proposal according to the guidelines for each course action type:
   - For creating a new course, provide a clear rationale, course title, and detailed course description, along with learning objectives, prerequisites, assessment methods, and resources>
   - For changing an existing course, outline the desired modifications, including reasons and any necessary updates, and describe how the changes align with the university's academic standards.
   - For terminating a course, justify the decision and discuss alternatives for students to fulfill the same learning objectives.

3. Consult with the head of your academic unit (Department Chair) and your Academic Program Liaison (APL) for guidance.

4. Use the Academic Programs Proposal System (APPS) to submit your proposal. Log in and begin a new proposal, selecting the appropriate course action type. Complete the required fields and upload your prepared documents.

5. Follow the instructions provided in APPS to route your proposal through the approval process, which typically includes reviews by the Department Chair, College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses, and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council.

For further details, consult the "Course Development" page on the University of South Carolina's Office of the Provost website.

Response: The critical courses on major maps are essential components of a given program of study, providing foundational knowledge and skills necessary for success within the field. They typically cover key concepts, theories, methodologies, and techniques central to the discipline.

Response: A syllabus should ideally consist of three main parts: (1) Course Description, (2) Course Outline, and (3) Policies and Procedures. 

1. Course Description should include the course title, number, meeting location and times, instructor contact information, office hours, learning outcomes, required textbooks or readings, and course prerequisites.

2. Course Outline should include a topical outline of content to be covered, time allocation framework, topics and timeline, reading assignments due dates, test and exam dates, and changes should be reasonable and justified.

3. Policies and Procedures should describe how you will treat students, what you expect of them, and what they can expect from you. It should also include a statement of academic integrity, attendance policy, students with disabilities, and evaluation of assignments, projects, quizzes, and/or exams.

Response: An integrative course is a type of course designed to help students raise their awareness about purposeful involvement and integrative learning. It combines various aspects of learning, allowing students to connect their experiences with their academic learning. These courses often encourage reflection on the connection between experiences and academic study, helping students apply what they've learned to solve problems and make decisions.

For instance, at the University of South Carolina (USC), there are several integrative courses such as ECIV 101: Introduction to Civil Engineering, ECIV 201: Computational Methods for Civil Engineering, SLIS 735: Metadata, SUS 732: Indexing and Abstracting, SPTE 590: The Business of Broadway, JOUR 499-001: Freelancing for Creative Professionals, and JOUR 499-002: Entrepreneurship for Creative Professionals.

Changes to existing courses require approval by the Unit Head, Office of Distributed Learning (if adding DL delivery), College/School Representative, Carolina Core Committee (if change is to or adding a Carolina Core course), and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Changes may include hours, bulletin description, pre-requisites, etc. Course terminations require approval at Department, College Representative, Curricula and Courses/Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Proposals for course termination are submitted in APPS. The C & C committee, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council may request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns. Designating a course as Carolina Core requires approval by the Carolina Core Committee.

Response: Program actions involve various steps to approve new programs, program modifications, and certificates at the University of South Carolina. Here is the process for each:

1. New Program:
   - Propose a new program using the New Program Proposal Form and submit it to the Office of Academic Programs before the deadline.
   - The proposal goes through several levels of approval, including the College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses, Faculty Senate, and the Board of Trustees Academic Excellence Committee (BOT AESEC).
   - Once approved by BOT AESEC, the proposal is discussed by the full Board of Trustees.
   - After approval from the Board of Trustees, the program appears in the next Bulletin.

2. Program Modification:
   - Propose a program modification using the Program Modification Proposal Form and submit it to the Office of Academic Programs before the deadline.
   - The proposal goes through several levels of approval, including the College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses, Faculty Senate, and the Board of Trustees Academic Excellence Committee (BOT AESEC).
   - Once approved by BOT AESEC, the proposal is discussed by the full Board of Trustees.
   - After approval from the Board of Trustees, the modified program appears in the next Bulletin.

3. New Certificate:
   - Similar to new programs, propose a new certificate using the New Program Proposal Form and submit it to the Office of Academic Programs before the deadline.
   - The proposal goes through several levels of approval, including the College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses, Faculty Senate, and the Board of Trustees Academic Excellence Committee (BOT AESEC).
   - Once approved by BOT AESEC, the proposal is discussed by the full Board of Trustees.
   - After approval from the Board of Trustees, the certificate appears in the next Bulletin.

The timeline for these actions varies but typically follows the shortest possible time to process a proposal through the approval cycle. If deadlines are not met, the proposal will rotate into the next subsequent cycle.

Response: When creating cross-listed courses, both departments involved need to submit corresponding program changes. Letters of concurrence are only required if the pre-/co-requisites involve another department or program. Cross-listed courses do not necessarily require additional proposals, but they do need to meet all the usual requirements for course proposals, such as having matching titles, descriptions, pre-/co-requisites, and learning outcomes in both departments' bulletins.

Response: To ensure timely and smooth submission via Research.gov, it is best practice to submit your proposal to the SAM Team Representative at least 3 business days before the proposal submission deadline. However, submitting the proposal even earlier, such as several weeks before the deadline, is preferable. This allows your SAM Team Representative to thoroughly review the proposal materials and ensure that sponsor guidelines have been followed. Always refer to the NSF Grant Proposal Guide for the most current information on proposal requirements, as it is updated annually and goes into effect the following January.

Response: If a user has questions or concerns about the content of a student's DegreeWorks audit which they are unable to resolve, they should contact the Registrar’s office for their campus, generally speaking, students should not contact the Registrar directly, and should work through their Advisor. The DegreeWorks is currently being offered as a helpful reference for advisors (and students on select campuses), but should not be taken as an official source of information. Please be aware of the following issues: upper level undergraduate students who have been admitted to any USC campus for graduate school, law school, or medical school will not be presented with an audit of your undergraduate degree at this time. Certain academic history items may not be accurately reflected; this includes credits for Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses (AP, IB), coursework transferred from another college/university, study abroad coursework, or courses taken on another USC campus. Any exceptions and course substitutions previously authorized by your advisor or department chair may not be accurately recorded in DegreeWorks. Please keep an eye out for these and contact your advisor to resolve these again. Students taking courses or pursuing a degree on more than one USC campus at the same time, may have a degree audit that is not entirely accurate or complete for either campus. If you are unable to login, you may contact the UTS Service Desk between the hours of 9:00 - 5:00, Monday-Friday (except holidays), at servicedesk@sc.edu or 803-777-1800. Please provide your University network username and a clear description of your login issue. UTS cannot provide support or answer questions about the content of audits; only Advisors or Registrar personnel are authorized to address such concerns. Instructions: please check the availability of your campus' DegreeWorks audit service. If available click the campus name to enter the system. Campus Available?

Response: Faculty should know about DegreeWorks because it is a web-based degree auditing tool that helps students and advisors monitor progress toward degree completion. By understanding how DegreeWorks functions, faculty can better assist students in choosing the most appropriate courses to fulfill degree requirements and ensure that all degree applicable credit is applied correctly. Furthermore, faculty can use DegreeWorks to run "what if" and "look ahead" scenarios for students who are considering changing majors or degrees. Overall, DegreeWorks serves as a valuable resource for staying informed about students' academic progress and providing guidance throughout their college journey.

Response: Each part of term has specific drop, add, and refund dates. These dates are listed in the context information provided. If you drop a class before its respective drop date, you might be eligible for a refund depending on the type of tuition charge associated with the class. However, dropping classes can also affect your financial aid package and academic standing. It's essential to review the drop/add/refund dates and consult with the appropriate offices, such as the Bursar's Office and the University Registrar, to understand the implications fully.

Response: If a student does not attend their graduation ceremony, their name will still be listed in the program. This is because the program is generated using the list of graduating students, regardless of attendance. However, if the student fails to submit their graduation application before the deadline for program edits, their name may not be included in the program. It's essential to check the deadlines and submit the application promptly to ensure inclusion in the program.

Response: Your name will be listed in the program even if you do not attend, as long as your graduation application was submitted before the deadline for program edits. However, you will not be announced during the ceremony. This policy ensures that all graduates are recognized fairly while respecting those who cannot attend.

Response: To request additional tickets for Gamecock football, men’s and women’s basketball, and baseball games as a student taking fewer than 12 credit hours, you need to add the student ticket fee to your bill through the Bursar’s Office. You can find the instructions on how to do this on the Bursar’s self-service carolina tutorials page. Once you've paid the fee, you will be eligible to participate in the student ticketing process. Tickets are granted through a priority points system, so earning more points by attending various Gamecock Athletics events increases your chances of getting a ticket for marquee matchups. Make sure to download the Student Rewards App and register with your University of South Carolina email. For help requesting your ticket, refer to the Request Guide.

Response: If you apply for graduation late, you may not have your name included in the program. However, ticket availability for additional guests is determined by the dates mentioned in the context. After submitting your graduation application, check the Commencement Tickets portal (<https://gamecocksonline.com/tickets-commencement/>) for ticket distribution details. Keep in mind that if you are found selling or buying guest tickets, they may be revoked, and you might not be able to participate in commencement ceremonies.

Response: If a student does not attend their graduation ceremony, their name will still be listed in the program. This is because the program is generated using the list of graduating students, regardless of attendance. However, if the student fails to submit their graduation application before the deadline for program edits, their name may not be included in the program. It's essential to check the deadlines and submit the application promptly to ensure inclusion in the program.

However, you will not be announced during the ceremony. This policy ensures that all graduates are recognized fairly while respecting those who cannot attend.

Response: To answer your question, I would need more specific details about the program you are referring to. However, if you are asking whether the University of South Carolina (USC) Honors College includes honors designation on diplomas, then yes, honors students are recognized by special regalia at commencement. But, there is no mention of a specific program that includes "honors" in the context you provided.

Response: To graduate with honors from the University of South Carolina Honors College, you must complete a robust curriculum of 44 credit hours including a senior thesis. However, if you have plans to graduate early, be abroad for an entire year, or have other rigorous obligations in your field of study, the additional Honors requirements might not be suitable for you. To apply for the Honors College as a current USC student, meet the eligibility requirements, submit the application by April 15, 2025, and complete the application process. If accepted, you will be given instructions to complete the transfer process for entry into the Honors College the following fall semester and connect with an advisor specializing in Honors curriculum to make schedule adjustments.

Response: As a student participating in the Bachelor, Master's, or Professional commencement ceremony at the University of South Carolina, you will have the opportunity to record your name and provide phonetic pronunciation through an online portal. To do so, look out for an email with instructions on how to access the portal. The portal's open and close dates are available on the Deadline Dates page. Make sure to complete the process before it closes to ensure the correct pronunciation of your name. If you prefer not to use the portal, an announcer will record your name based on professional judgment. During the ceremony, bring your barcoded name card with you, hand it to a commencement marshal before crossing the stage, and wait for your name to be announced before proceeding.

Response: The University of South Carolina offers various majors, minors, and concentrations for students to choose from. While I cannot predict which specific ones will be announced in the future, you can explore the current options by visiting the USC Codebook (<a href="http://web.csd.sc.edu/codebook/">http://web.csd.sc.edu/codebook/</a>) and using the Simple Search function to find the MINOR codes.

Response: The context indicates that transcripts can be ordered online or at USC Columbia, and a transcript request is typically processed within 2-3 days after receipt. However, if you have a financial obligation to the university, your transcript will not be released. It is essential to confirm that all grades and degrees have been posted to your record, check the accuracy of your name, and verify the accuracy of the recipient's email address or mailing address before ordering a transcript. If you are a current or past student who knows their Self Service Carolina username and password, you can order a transcript using Self Service Carolina. If you are a past student who does not know their Self Service Carolina username and password, you can order a transcript through the Parchment Ordering Service. Current USC students can order an official transcript via my.sc.edu, and former students can order an official transcript through Parchment Ordering Services. When ordering a transcript online through Parchment, you will be able to choose your mailing option – Standard USPS, International USPS, FedEx Domestic, or FedEx International. Review Your Transcript in my.sc.edu to ensure all final grades have been posted and all degrees have been awarded before ordering a transcript.

Based on this information, I would recommend ordering your transcript once you have confirmed that all grades and degrees have been posted to your record, checked the accuracy of your name, verified the accuracy of the recipient's email address or mailing address, and ensured there are no financial obligations to the university. To order your transcript online through Parchment, create a new account using your current personal email address if you haven't already, and choose the appropriate mailing option based on your preference. After placing the order, review your transcript in my.sc.edu to ensure all final grades have been posted and all degrees have been awarded before the transcript is sent.

Response: To graduate with honors from the University of South Carolina Honors College, you must complete a robust curriculum of 44 credit hours including a senior thesis. However, if you have plans to graduate early, be abroad for an entire year, or have other rigorous obligations in your field of study, the additional Honors requirements might not be suitable for you. To apply for the Honors College as a current USC student, meet the eligibility requirements, submit the application by April 15, 2025, and complete the application process. If accepted, you will be given instructions to complete the transfer process for entry into the Honors College the following fall semester and connect with an advisor specializing in Honors curriculum to make schedule adjustments.

Response: Online students at the University of South Carolina (USC) must provide immunization records. They need to submit their immunization records to register for classes, regardless of where they will live. If they are concerned that they will not be able to complete the immunization requirements before they arrive on campus, University Health Services will allow them to take care of their immunizations once they arrive at USC. However, they must make sure that their health insurance is active before getting the immunizations done.

Response: Getting started with research involves several steps, but don't worry if you don't have a project or mentor yet. First, consider attending a Getting Started in Research Workshop or watching the workshop video located in the Getting Started in Research Toolkit. These resources can help you navigate the research process and understand funding opportunities.

If you already have a project and mentor, remember to register your project every semester for it to appear on your My USC Experience transcript. Additionally, explore tips, hints, and resources to make the most of your research experience with your mentor.

For finding a research mentor, use our searchable research database to identify faculty with research interests similar to yours. Once you find a potential mentor, you can use our email signature generator and templates to craft a professional message expressing your interest.

Lastly, don't forget about resources and opportunities for undergraduate researchers, such as presenting or publishing your work. For further assistance, feel free to contact the Office of Undergraduate Research via email or phone.

Response: The tuition and fees for each semester at the University of South Carolina are typically due before the start of the term. Specific dates are provided in the bulletin, which is usually published in June. It is important to note that failure to make timely payments may result in penalties such as withheld diplomas, suspended services, assigned accounts to collection agencies, and the assessment of interest, finance charges, and late fees. All fees are payable in advance of or at registration. Make sure to check the bulletin or contact the university directly for the most accurate and up-to-date information regarding tuition and fee deadlines.

Response: Online exams at the University of South Carolina are administered through the Learning Management System (LMS), typically Blackboard. Instructors create an assessment within the LMS and share it with students during the designated time window specified in the course syllabus. Students access the exam through the LMS, complete it within the allowed time frame, and submit it for grading. It is essential to secure a reliable internet connection and a well-functioning computer before starting the exam. Late submissions might not be accepted without a valid excuse, as per the instructor's policy outlined in the syllabus. Remember to review all instructions carefully to avoid confusion and ensure understanding of any penalties for not completing the exam within the allotted time without a valid reason.

Response: Not all online tests at the University of South Carolina require proctoring. It depends on the instructor's preference and course requirements. Some online tests can be taken without proctoring, while others might require proctoring through the Distributed Learning Testing Center, ProctorU, or an approved testing site. Always refer to your course syllabus for specific testing expectations and instructions.

Response: To change your major, first ensure you meet the GPA and/or credit hour requirements for the new major by checking the [Change of Major Requirements Table](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/advising/changing_majors/major_requirements/index.php). Next, schedule an appointment with an Exploratory Advisor through the [Exploratory Advising website](http://sc.campus.eab.com/) to discuss your change of major. They will help you understand how your prior coursework fits into the new major and provide supplemental advisement. If you are changing majors within your current college or school, consult your assigned academic advisor. If you need further assistance, you can reach out to the College of Arts and Sciences – Office of Undergraduate Studies at [Flinn Hall Student Success Center](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_success_center/index.php) or the [USC Career Center](https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/career_center/).

Response: To get an override into a class that is already full at the University of South Carolina, follow these steps depending on your situation:

1. For CSCE courses, fill out the [Computer Science and Engineering Department Prerequisite Waiver](https://www.cse.sc.edu/undergraduate/forms/request-prerequisite-waiver) and the [other department’s form](https://www.cse.sc.edu/undergraduate/forms/override-request) if necessary.

2. For MATH courses, complete the [Temporary Prerequisite Waiver Request form](https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/study/overrides/) if you have taken an AP or IB class or are waiting for course credit from another institution to satisfy a prerequisite.

3. For Business School courses, refer to their [Registration FAQs page](https://sc.edu/study/business/current_students/registration_faqs) for instructions on obtaining overrides.

4. For ELCT courses, use the [CEC Waiting List Request Form](https://www.cse.sc.edu/undergraduate/forms/override-request).

5. For Honors College courses, submit an [override request](https://universityofsouthcarolina-yrckc.formstack.com/forms/override) during the designated period and provide a compelling reason for needing the override.

6. For non-Honors students taking Honors College courses, submit a [course override request](https://universityofsouthcarolina-yrckc.formstack.com/forms/override_copy) before the deadline, and have a high university GPA (3.5 or higher) with demonstrated mastery in the subject matter.

Remember that overrides are not guaranteed and will be reviewed in the order they are received. Allow up to one week for a decision, and continue monitoring seat availability in the meantime.

Response: The Pass-Fail option is a program at the University of South Carolina designed to encourage students to investigate fields outside of their major curriculum in which they have a specific personal interest without affecting their grade point average. Only two grades are assigned on courses taken under the Pass-Fail option: S (satisfactory performance) and U (unsatisfactory progress). A student will be given credit for courses in which the grade of S is earned, but these courses will not affect the computation of the grade point average. Specific provisions of the Pass-Fail program include it being in effect for an indefinite period of time, subject to periodic review, not being available to undergraduate students whose semester or cumulative GPA is less than 2.00, allowing students to exercise the Pass-Fail option only on free elective courses, limiting students to taking no more than eight courses on a Pass-Fail basis during their undergraduate career, requiring permission from the dean of the college and the student’s academic advisor, having a deadline to elect or revoke the option by the last date for withdrawing from the course without a penalty, allowing normal prerequisites to be waived for students taking a course on a Pass-Fail basis, excluding such courses from the calculation of the grade point average, entering a grade of S for a regularly assigned passing grade and U for a failing grade, and not counting any course carried on a Pass-Fail basis toward the hours required for either the President’s or the Dean’s Honor List. A verified learning-disabled student may take on a Pass-Fail basis an elective or required course which is not in the major if the academic advisory plan so recommends the Pass-Fail option for that course. Learning-disabled students may meet specific degree requirements with a satisfactory grade with the approval of the academic dean. For Spring 2020, undergraduate students enrolled in the semester had the following grading accommodations due to the COVID-19 pandemic: all courses will be graded as originally planned according to grading criteria in course syllabi, after grades are submitted at the end of the semester, undergraduates can choose, on a course-by-course basis, to request a pass/fail grade for the Spring 2020 semester with the exception of Graduate or professional school courses, which can be taken as pass/fail only when deemed appropriate by the program

Response: Yes, you can take courses at another institution during the summer, provided that they are from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution or have been recommended by a NACES-member external evaluation service if taken at a foreign post-secondary institution. However, you must have these transfer courses evaluated by the University before enrolling in class at the University to know definitively the transferability and equivalency of each transfer course. Keep in mind that transfer courses with a grade lower than 2.0 on a 4-point scale, or equivalent, taken by a degree-seeking University of South Carolina student without prior approval, or taken while a student is on an academic suspension from a University of South Carolina campus, will not be accepted. Also, courses that are occupational or technical in nature or essentially remedial in nature will not be applicable towards any University of South Carolina academic program or degree.

Response: To declare a minor, follow these steps:
1. Determine if the minor will extend your time to graduation, and if so, if the valued added is worth it; it often is.
2. Talk with your advisor about declaring a minor.
3. Ensure you meet the prerequisites for the desired minor. For example, for the Computer Science Minor, calculus is required.
4. Complete the necessary courses in the minor field of study, which may be in addition to or may overlap with some of your normal program requirements.
5. Submit a request to add the minor through Self-Service Carolina.

Response: To have a second major at the University of South Carolina, a student in the College of Arts and Sciences may complete a second major within the College of Arts and Sciences or the School of Music (Bachelor of Arts track only). The student must complete all collegiate requirements, including general education courses and special departmental requirements, as well as the major requirements for the second major. In cases where one major is part of a Bachelor of Arts program and the other is part of a Bachelor of Science program, the student must designate one as the official degree of record. A second major eliminates the cognate requirement, but special departmental requirements normally completed as part of the cognate are not waived. Fulfillment of the requirements for a second major is indicated on the student’s official transcript upon graduation. No notation for a second major is placed on the official transcript for course work completed after graduation. Students who submit two degree applications for the same degree in the same college for a double major will receive one diploma. Indebtedness is expected to be discharged as quickly as possible. No diploma, certificate, or enrollment verification will be issued to or for students who have not made satisfactory settlement with the Office of Financial Services for all of their indebtedness to the University.

Response: A second degree refers to the process where a student earns two distinct degrees by fulfilling the specific requirements for each degree program, including all general education and special departmental requirements. This typically means completing separate degree applications and having approvals from both deans. However, if both majors lead to different degrees, only one degree will be designated as the official record. Additionally, students must settle any outstanding debts to the University before receiving diplomas or certificates.

Response: Yes, you can choose specific (prescribed) courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program. Many majors require specific Carolina Core courses, and not all courses listed on the website may apply to all majors. Your advisor will share more about this at orientation. However, keep in mind that prior coursework received and processed by the University will also appear in DegreeWorks, which you can access by logging in to Self-Service Carolina and selecting the student tab.

Response: When curriculum changes are made to a cross-listed course, those changes typically affect all cross-listed courses as well. This is because cross-listed courses are essentially different academic departments offering the same course. However, there might be specific exceptions depending on individual agreements between departments. In such cases, the dean of the college or the head of the department in which the course is majoring would need to be consulted for clarification.

Response: Carolina Core Overlay courses allow students to meet two Carolina Core components within a single course. You can choose from several overlay-approved courses, and a maximum of two overlays is allowed. The total Carolina Core credit hours for your program must add up to a minimum of 31 hours. Some programs may have a higher number of minimum Carolina Core hours due to specified requirements. Make sure to check the specific requirements for your program.

Response: To change your program learning outcomes at the University of South Carolina, follow these steps:

1. Identify the specific learning outcomes you wish to modify within your program curriculum. Review the existing learning outcomes provided by the Center for Teaching Excellence and ensure they align with your desired changes.
2. Consult with important stakeholders such as university administration, school leadership, and faculty members to gather input and reach a consensus on the proposed modifications.
3. Submit a proposal to update the learning outcomes through the appropriate channels, usually through your department chair or academic unit head.
4. Once approved, implement the changes in your courses, syllabi, and other relevant materials. Make sure to communicate the updates to students and colleagues.
5. Periodically evaluate the effectiveness of the new learning outcomes and adjust as necessary based on feedback and assessment data.

Keep in mind that learning outcomes should be specific, measurable, agreed upon, and aligned with the institution's mission and goals.

Response: To determine if you need a curriculum change proposal for making changes in the Bulletin, consider the following factors:

1. Description: Check if the course description requires updating or revising. If so, a curriculum change proposal is necessary.

2. Hours: If the course hours are changing, you'll need to submit a curriculum change proposal specifying the maximum and minimum credit hours for each credit option.

3. Grading Scale and Assignments: Ensure that a grading scale and assignments are provided for each credit hour if the course offers variable credits.

4. Prerequisites/Co-requisites: If there are changes to these requirements, ensure they're included in the proposal and syllabus. Also, verify if the changes involve another department/program, and confirm if corresponding program changes have been submitted.

5. Delivery Mode: If there's a significant change in delivery mode to >50% online, a curriculum change proposal is needed.

If none of the above apply, double-check the proposal against the syllabus for discrepancies.

Response: To propose a course action at the University of South Carolina, there are specific steps you need to follow. First, identify whether you want to create a new course, change an existing course, or terminate a course.

For creating a new course, you should submit a proposal through APPS, including a completed syllabus aligned with the University's policies and requirements like learning outcomes, required textbooks, student support, disability, and academic integrity. The proposal will then be reviewed by the Unit Head, College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses Committee, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. They might request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns.

If you want to change an existing course, the process is similar. You need to propose the change through APPS, and it requires approval from the Unit Head, Office of Distributed Learning (if adding DL delivery), College/School Representative, Carolina Core Committee (if changing to or adding a Carolina Core course), and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Changes may include hours, bulletin descriptions, pre-requisites, etc.

Lastly, to terminate a course, you need approval from the Department, College Representative, Curricula and Courses/Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Proposals for course termination are submitted in APPS, and the C & C committee, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council may request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns.

Response: For a proposal to go through various levels of approval in the Academic Programs Proposal System (APPS), it may take several days. After the curriculum committee considers the proposal, the Graduate Council or the Faculty Senate will review it depending on the course level. They will either approve the proposal or return it to the academic unit for revisions. If revisions are requested and made within the stated timeframe, the proposal will be sent out the Friday before the Graduate Council meeting that month. Final recommendations will be communicated by the chairs of the curriculum committees to the Graduate Council. Graduate Council meetings are open, except for agenda items pertaining to personnel or student files. All faculty and staff are invited to attend. Dates and times vary, so check the Graduate School home page or contact Wanda Barr at (803) 777-1875 or wandab@mailbox.sc.edu for specific details.

Response: Critical courses on major maps refer to the essential courses that must be taken within a specific program of study at the University of South Carolina (USC). They are part of the recommended sequence of courses for each program, which helps students plan their studies and ensure a clear path to graduation. These courses may vary depending on the chosen field of study; therefore, it's crucial to consult with an academic advisor for guidance in course selection and planning for upcoming semesters.

Response: A syllabus should include a clear and detailed course description, including learning objectives, expectations for academic integrity, attendance policy, accommodations for students with disabilities, evaluation methods, grading scale, and a course outline or schedule with brief descriptions of each topic or activity. It should also specify assignment requirements and weights, and include statements regarding the distribution of course materials and acceptable use of social media. Additionally, it's important to minimize opportunities for academic integrity violations through assessment design and to have a clear policy on reporting violations and assigning penalties. The syllabus should be written in a logical and consistent format with headings for easy navigation.

Response: A concentration is a specific field or area of focus within a degree program, typically requiring at least 18 credit hours of coursework. At the University of South Carolina, concentrations must be approved by the Committee for Higher Education (CHE).

Response: An integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. These courses aim to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. The purpose of integrative courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. Regulatory oversight for integrative courses is ceded predominantly to the academic unit, meaning each department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporate one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes.

To add the Carolina Core designation to an existing course or submit a new course proposal with the Carolina Core information completed, use the APPS system. If you need assistance, follow the instructions provided on the Carolina Core website: https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/faculty-and-staff/learning-outcomes.php

Response: DegreeWorks is an online tool that helps students and their advisors monitor students' progress towards degree completion. It matches student record data, such as courses and grades, with degree requirements to identify which courses meet those requirements and which ones still need to be completed. This tool also enables users to explore "what if" and "look ahead" scenarios, showing how prospective courses will apply to a student's major and applying a student's course history to another program of study. DegreeWorks is integrated with students' academic records in Banner and assists both students and advisors in selecting the most appropriate courses to fulfill degree requirements.

Response: Progression requirements typically refer to the conditions or standards that students need to meet in order to advance in their academic programs. From the provided context, there are different examples of progression requirements mentioned for various programs at the University of South Carolina (USC). Here are some key components found in these requirements:

1. **Minimum GPA**: Students must maintain a certain Grade Point Average (GPA) in their overall studies as well as specific subjects. For instance, achieving an Overall GPA of 2.75 or higher and a GPA of 3.0 or higher in Education courses is necessary for Early Childhood Education students.

2. **Specific course completion**: Completion of certain courses with specific grades is essential before moving forward. An example includes completing ENGL 101 and ENGL 102 with a grade of 'C' or better for most programs.

3. **Prerequisites**: Some courses may require successful completion of other courses as prerequisites. For example, specific science and math courses might need to be finished before taking upper-level classes.

4. **Assessments and examinations**: Passing certain assessments or examinations may be mandatory. For instance, the EEDA assessment is a requirement for Early Childhood Education Professional Program admission.

5. **Deadlines**: Meeting deadlines for submitting scores or applications, like submitting Praxis Core and EEDA requirements by December 1st prior to entering junior spring block courses in the Early Childhood Education program.

Remember that each program has its unique set of progression requirements, so it's important to check the specific guidelines for the chosen area of study.

The process for course actions at the University of South Carolina involves several steps. To propose a new course, you need approval from the Unit Head, College/School Representative, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. The proposal should be submitted through APPS, and the Curricula and Courses committee or Faculty Senate or Graduate Council might request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns.

For changing an existing course, you also require approval from the Unit Head, Office of Distributed Learning (if adding DL delivery), College/School Representative, Carolina Core Committee (if changing to or adding a Carolina Core course), and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Changes may include various aspects like hours, bulletin description, or pre-requisites. Proposals for course changes are submitted in APPS, with possible program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns.

Lastly, terminating a course requires approval from the Department, College Representative, Curricula and Courses/Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Proposals for course termination are submitted in APPS, with potential program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns. The Carolina Core Courses can be designated as foundational.

Response: Cross-listed courses typically require additional proposals when they involve significant changes in course description, a change in Carolina Core or GLD designation, or a change in delivery mode to over 50% online. However, if the cross-listed courses only share the same course content and requirements between departments, a single proposal with letters of concurrence from both departments might suffice. It's essential to carefully review the context to determine if additional proposals or letters of concurrence are necessary.

Response: A syllabus is required for a proposal when submitting a new course proposal or revising an existing course at the University of South Carolina. The syllabus should align with InDev requirements and all other university policies, including learning outcomes, required textbooks, student support, disability accommodations, and academic integrity expectations. For new permanent courses, please contact the Chair of the Curriculum Committee for an appropriate new course number. Any changes to courses must consider prerequisites, corequisites, and other requirements of the course undergoing revision. Once approved by the Curriculum Committee, the proposal will move forward for iSchool faculty approval, followed by the CIC Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for submission via the U of SC App system.

2024-12-12 04:05:47,058 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: To ensure your proposal is effective for the next Bulletin year, materials should be submitted after the first of May or the first of December. However, keep in mind that these submissions won't be reviewed until the start of the following semester. You can track your submission's progress through the Academic Programs Proposal System (APPS), which may take several days due to various levels of approval.

Curriculum committees review proposals during the second week of each month. Afterward, the Graduate Council or the Faculty Senate will review the proposal depending on its level. They might approve it or request revisions. If revisions are made within the specified timeframe, the proposal will be sent out before the Graduate Council meeting that month, with final recommendations communicated by the curriculum committees' chairs. Graduate Council meetings are open, except for personnel or student files-related items. All faculty and staff are welcome to attend, usually on the fourth Monday of each month during the academic year, excluding December and May. In those months, meetings occur on the second Monday. Locations are announced to department chairs and graduate directors and are available on the Graduate School homepage.

Response: If a user has questions or concerns about the content of a student's DegreeWorks audit which they are unable to resolve, they should contact the Registrar’s office for their campus, generally speaking, students should not contact the Registrar directly, and should work through their Advisor. The DegreeWorks is currently being offered as a helpful reference for advisors (and students on select campuses), but should not be taken as an official source of information. Please be aware of the following issues: upper level undergraduate students who have been admitted to any USC campus for graduate school, law school, or medical school will not be presented with an audit of your undergraduate degree at this time. Certain academic history items may not be accurately reflected; this includes credits for Advanced Placement and International Baccalaureate courses (AP, IB), coursework transferred from another college/university, study abroad coursework, or courses taken on another USC campus. Any exceptions and course substitutions previously authorized by your advisor or department chair may not be accurately recorded in DegreeWorks. Please keep an eye out for these and contact your advisor to resolve these again. Students taking courses or pursuing a degree on more than one USC campus at the same time, may have a degree audit that is not entirely accurate or complete for either campus. If you are unable to login, you may contact the UTS Service Desk between the hours of 9:00 - 5:00, Monday-Friday (except holidays), at servicedesk@sc.edu or 803-777-1800. Please provide your University network username and a clear description of your login issue. UTS cannot provide support or answer questions about the content of audits; only Advisors or Registrar personnel are authorized to address such concerns. Instructions: please check the availability of your campus' DegreeWorks audit service. If available click the campus name to enter the system. Campus Available?

Response: Faculty should familiarize themselves with DegreeWorks because it is a web-based degree auditing tool that students and advisors can use to monitor progress toward degree completion. This tool helps students and advisors ensure that all degree applicable credit is applied correctly, plan for future course advisement, and choose the most appropriate courses to fulfill degree requirements. By understanding how DegreeWorks functions, faculty can better guide students in meeting their academic goals and staying on track to graduate.

Response: To answer your question, whether a proposal requires a letter of concurrence depends on its specific details. Based on the context given, it seems like there might be instances where a letter of concurrence is necessary, especially when the proposal impacts another unit on campus. However, the context does not mention any requirement for a letter of concurrence regarding your proposal. To ensure compliance, consult with the appropriate individuals or offices involved in the process, and confirm if such a letter is needed.

Response: Based on the provided context, your proposal might require external approvals depending on the nature of the program. Specifically, new programs that are considered a significant departure may require the submission of a prospectus to SACSCOC. Additionally, educator-preparation programs may require additional approvals by the State Department of Education. It's essential to consult the Calendar/Approval Timelines to know important dates and deadlines for these approvals. If you're uncertain, it's recommended to contact the Office of Academic Programs for guidance.

Response: The drop/add period is a specific time frame during which undergraduate students can add or remove courses from their schedule through Self Service Carolina. It starts on the official first day of the course and continues for a minimum of 6% of the Part of Term 1 in which the course is scheduled. If you drop a course during this period, it won't be recorded on your transcript.

The withdrawal period allows undergraduate students to withdraw from a course with no grade penalty through Self Service Carolina. This period begins after the free drop/add period and extends to a minimum of 72% of the Part of Term 1 in which the course is scheduled. When you withdraw during this period, the course will be recorded on your transcript with a 'W', but it won't affect your grade point average, earned hours, or graded hours.

The withdrawal fail period enables undergraduate students to withdraw from a course with a penalty grade through Self Service Carolina. This period starts after the withdrawal period and goes through the last day of class for the part of term 1 in which the course is scheduled. If you withdraw during this period, the course will be marked as an 'WF', which is treated as an 'F' in the evaluation of academic standing, computation of grade point average, and graded hours.

Regarding getting money back for dropped classes, if you drop a course within the scheduled refund period, you can expect to receive a refund in approximately four to six weeks. However, if you have any financial obligations to the University, these amounts will be deducted from any refund due. Refunds for students who received and used financial aid to pay academic fees may be applied toward repayment of financial aid. Students who have long-term loans through the University must contact the Student Loan Accounting Office for an exit interview to avoid holds being placed on transcripts.

Response: If you're having trouble enrolling in a class you need, there could be several reasons why. First, check if there's a registration restriction by viewing the course information on the classes.sc.edu website or using the "How to Identify Class Registration Restrictions" video guide. You might find that the class is reserved for specific student populations or has pre- or co-requisites.

If the class is open to all students but still unavailable, try finding an open section or checking if the department provides online forms for seat notifications. You can also use apps like Coursicle to track course enrollment and receive notifications when a seat becomes available.

If you require a pre- or co-requisite override or need to take a placement test, contact the specific department to see if overrides can be granted. Make sure to complete any necessary forms or tests before attempting to enroll in the class.

Lastly, if you have already taken the prerequisite course but it's not reflected in your record, ensure the Admissions Office has received proof of completion. USC may not accept external credits for certain courses, so double-check the USC policy on transferring credits.

In summary, carefully review the context provided to identify the issue and follow the suggested steps to resolve your enrollment problem. If you're still unable to enroll, consider reaching out to your academic advisor for further assistance.

Response: If you are late applying for graduation, you can expect to receive ticketing updates from the Office of the University Registrar daily, usually during the afternoon. You should allow 1-2 business days to claim your tickets via the Student Account Manager once they become available. If you require further assistance retrieving your tickets, you can reach out to graduatetickets@sc.edu for support. Dual degree graduates are allowed to sit with the college of their choice, but they must email graduate@sc.edu to make arrangements. Keep in mind that your name will be listed in the program if you submit your graduation application before the deadline for program edits. However, your name may still appear in the program even if you don't attend. Honors based on your GPA at the time of printing will be noted in the program, while final honors will be reflected on your transcript and diploma approximately 30 days after all degrees have been awarded.

Response: The Honors College is an option for students who demonstrate superior academic achievement and desire a challenging educational experience. To be considered for the Honors College, students must have a minimum high school GPA of 3.50 and either a score of 1200 on the Math and Critical Reading portions of the SAT or a composite score of 27 on the ACT. Once admitted to USC, students may apply to the Honors College by submitting a separate application, which includes detailed recommendations from enthusiastic faculty in academic subjects. Admitted students will complete a robust curriculum of 44 credit hours including a senior thesis. Therefore, students who have plans to graduate early, be abroad for an entire year, or have other rigorous obligations in their field of study may not be best served by the addition of Honors requirements. Deadlines for the application will be made available on this page in February 2025. Current USC students who meet the eligibility requirements must complete the application by April 15, 2025. All applicants will be notified of the decision by email in May. Application review is holistic, considering students' academic achievements, extracurricular involvement, and potential contributions to the Honors College community. No preference is given for applications submitted early. All aspects of the application must be submitted by April 15, 2025. There are no exceptions. Applications are read by the Transfer Review Committee, a group composed of Honors College faculty and staff. Decisions are final. The committee is unable to provide details on decisions for individual applications. Accepted students will be notified in May and given the opportunity to accept or decline the offer. If accepted, students will be given instructions to complete the transfer process for entry into the Honors College the following fall semester. They will also be connected with an advisor specializing in Honors curriculum to make schedule adjustments. Generally, this includes adding one to three Honors classes. Further questions regarding transfer admission into the Honors College can be answered by reviewing our frequently asked questions page.

Response: To graduate with honors from the University of South Carolina's Honors College, students must complete a robust curriculum of 44 credit hours including a senior thesis. If you have plans to graduate early, study abroad for an entire year, or have other rigorous obligations in your field of study, you may not be best served by the addition of Honors requirements. Students should check the eligibility requirements and submit the application by April 15, 2025. All decisions will be notified in May, and accepted students will be given instructions to complete the transfer process for entry into the Honors College the following fall semester.

Response: As a student participating in the Bachelor, Master's, or Professional commencement ceremony at the University of South Carolina, you will have the opportunity to record your name and provide phonetic pronunciation through an online portal. To do so, look out for an email with instructions on how to access the portal. The portal's open and close dates are available on the Deadline Dates page. Make sure to complete the process before it closes to ensure the correct pronunciation of your name. If you prefer not to use the portal, an announcer will record your name based on professional judgment. During the ceremony, bring your barcoded name card with you, hand it to a commencement marshal before crossing the stage, and wait for your name to be announced before proceeding.

Response: To request an ADA accommodation at the University of South Carolina, follow these steps:

1. Complete the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) Accommodation Request Form.
2. Have your healthcare provider fill out the Information Needed From Your Health Care Provider form.
3. Submit both forms to the Division of Human Resources' Employee Relations Office via email at uscer@mailbox.sc.edu.

Once your request is approved, you will receive an official letter of approval.

If you already have an existing, approved arrangement for workplace accommodations and need to renew or revise it, follow the same process outlined above. However, if no changes are needed, there's no need for further action unless the terms of the approval have ended.

Response: To graduate with honors from the University of South Carolina's Honors College, students must complete a robust curriculum of 44 credit hours including a senior thesis. If you have plans to graduate early, study abroad for an entire year, or have other rigorous obligations in your field of study, you may not be best served by the addition of Honors requirements. Students should check the eligibility requirements and submit the application by April 15, 2025. All decisions will be notified in May, and accepted students will be given instructions to complete the transfer process for entry into the Honors College the following fall semester.

Response: Graduation with Leadership Distinction (GLD) will appear on both the transcript and diploma, while Latin Honors and Departmental Honors only appear on the transcript. So, if you earn GLD, it will be visible on your diploma, but Latin Honors and/or Departmental Honors will not appear on the diploma, only the transcript.

Response: Current students: Log in to https://my.sc.edu and sign in to the Self Services Carolina (SSC) Program to register. Non-USC students: Apply for admission depending on your circumstances (e.g., degree-seeking or non-degree seeking) and the level of the course or program of study in which you are interested. For additional information about admission requirements, visit the Undergraduate Admissions Office or the Graduate School websites. If the course has restrictions (i.e., enrollment capacity, field of study, campus, etc.), you may need to contact the department offering the course to request an override to enroll in the course. Override requests are handled by the departments within the college/school offering the course and require their approval.

Response: tags to format your answer appropriately.

Answer: Yes, online students do have to provide immunization records. However, they can submit the Distance Learner Exemption Form instead of submitting their immunization records each semester. But, if they choose to get their immunizations done at USC, they must ensure their health insurance is active before getting the immunizations done.

Response: To access the library's online resources, there are several options available for both on and off-campus users. 

If you're on campus, simply visit the library website and start searching for articles, books, or other resources directly. However, if you're off-campus, you will need to use your network username and password to access these resources.

For a specific library database, first go to the University Libraries' FAQ page (<https://sc.edu/libraries/faqs.php>) and find the "How do I access a specific library database?" section. Here, you'll learn how to locate the database you need and log in with your credentials.

If you encounter any issues, don't hesitate to contact the library's support for assistance (<https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/university_libraries/ask_a_librarian/index.php>). They're always ready to help!

Response: As an enrolled student at the University of South Carolina, your CarolinaCard serves as your library card. However, if you haven't visited campus to obtain a CarolinaCard, you can still access library resources with your network username and password. To manage your library account, log in to the online library system(https://pascal-usc.primo.exlibrisgroup.com/discovery/account?vid=01PASCAL_USCCOL:USC) using your credentials for requesting and renewing materials, checking due dates, and saving favorite items to personal lists.

Online exams are administered based on the course instructor's discretion, so consult the course syllabus for details. Not all online tests are proctored, and if your exam is protected by ProctorU, you will be required to pay an $8-14 fee for online proctoring, depending on the exam length. For questions not covered on this page, contact ODL at DLQuest@mailbox.sc.edu.

2024-12-12 04:08:45,407 - __main__ - INFO - 
Response: Online exams at the University of South Carolina are typically administered using a proctored environment. To ensure a fair testing experience, instructors may create a practice exam for students to familiarize themselves with the online testing platform. They also provide tips for setting up an effective testing environment at home. Instead of relying on high-stakes exams, they might shift to shorter, more frequent exams with various question types to make it harder for students to look up answers on the internet. Some instructors use tools like Respondus Monitor and/or Respondus LockDown Browser to secure the testing environment. In case of suspected cheating, they make a verbal announcement to the whole class about observed behaviors and address the issue privately with the student(s) involved. If necessary, they may ask the student to relinquish unpermitted materials and continue the exam on a blank copy. For follow-up, they send an email to all students stating concerns and let them know about potential cheating consequences. After the exam, they review the concerning exams, outline the suspicious behaviors, and document the incident through the Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity report form. Grades or penalties are not imposed until the student completes the academic integrity process.

Response: Not all online tests are proctored, but the University of South Carolina offers test proctoring services for blended and online courses. There are two options for online test proctoring: Respondus Monitor and ProctorU. Respondus Monitor provides automated exam proctoring, while ProctorU allows students to take exams at times and locations that are convenient to them, with a certified proctor reviewing the testing session to ensure integrity. Students can also use a proctor from any accredited college or university offering testing services. For more information, visit the Office of Distributed Learning Test Proctoring page.

Response: An $8-14 fee for online proctoring is paid by students directly to ProctorU during their exam, depending on the length of the exam. Some universities and colleges have testing facilities or testing services offered through their online programs, which might not require a separate proctoring fee. It is essential to check with the specific institution regarding their policy.

Response: To change your major, you will need to schedule an appointment with the Exploratory Advising team by visiting this link: http://sc.campus.eab.com/. Keep in mind that each major has its own set of GPA and/or credit hour requirements that you must meet to change your major. Make sure to review the Change of Major Requirements Table here: https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/advising/changing_majors/major_requirements/index.php to ensure you meet the necessary qualifications before scheduling your appointment.

Response: If the class you want to join is part of the Mathematics Department and is numbered under 500, you can sign up for the notification list at https://forms.office.com/r/ZstZ4WJrfv. They will inform you when more seats are opened for the course, either in existing sections or new ones. Keep in mind that seats are given on a first-come, first-served basis, so make sure to register quickly once you receive the notification.

For courses in other departments or 500-level Math courses, you would need to fill out a prerequisite waiver form provided by the respective department. For instance, you can find the Computer Science and Engineering Department Prerequisite Waiver at https://www.cse.sc.edu/undergraduate/forms/request-prerequisite-waiver and the Mathematics Department Temporary Prerequisite Waiver at https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/study/overrides/. Remember that fulfilling the prerequisites is essential for success in upper-level courses, and overrides should not be seen as a way to bypass necessary foundational knowledge.

If you are an Honors College student seeking an override into an Honors College class, you can submit an override request during specific periods. Details regarding submission deadlines and policies can be found at https://my.sc.edu/web/honorscollege/current-students/course-overrides-for-honors-students.

Lastly, non-Honors students can request overrides into Honors College classes if there are available seats in the course. However, priority is given to Honors students, and approval depends on factors such as a high university GPA (3.5 or higher) and demonstrated mastery in the subject matter. More information can be found at https://my.sc.edu/web/honorscollege/current-students/course-overrides-for-non-honors-students.

Response: The pass/fail option at the University of South Carolina allows students to take certain courses outside of their major curriculum without affecting their grade point average. Students will receive either an 'S' (satisfactory) or 'U' (unsatisfactory) grade for these courses. An 'S' grade signifies satisfactory performance while a 'U' grade represents unsatisfactory progress. A student will still receive credit for courses with an 'S' grade, but it won't impact their GPA.

Response: Yes, you can take courses at another institution during the summer. However, with the approval of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, such approval is contingent upon satisfactory completion of the approved courses. The student must take the course for a letter grade if the course is offered on this basis. Grades of C or better will be recorded on your transcript as earned credit, and any grade below a C will not be included. “Incomplete” (or its equivalent) will be recorded as an F if the work is not completed within three months of the end of classes for the session involved. Limitations on the number of pass/fail hours apply to summer courses taken at other law schools.

Response: A second major refers to the completion of all major requirements for a major beyond your primary program of study. This allows you to gain expertise in two different fields while still pursuing a single degree. In the College of Arts and Sciences, you may complete a second major within the College or the School of Music (Bachelor of Arts track only), and it must include all major courses and special departmental requirements. Keep in mind that in cases where one major is part of a Bachelor of Arts program and the other is part of a Bachelor of Science program, you must designate one as the official degree of record.

Response: A "second degree" refers to pursuing another Master's degree after already having completed one from the University of South Carolina (USC). In general, to obtain a second Master's degree, a student must fulfill all the requirements of the desired degree, including coursework and exams. However, with the approval of the program and the dean of the Graduate Studies, up to 12 semester hours from the initial program of study can be applied towards the second USC degree. Keep in mind that grades from transferred credits do not factor into the USC grade point average. Transfer credit is added to the student's official academic transcript only during their term of graduation.
