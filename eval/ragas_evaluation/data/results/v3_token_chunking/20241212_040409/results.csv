It's essential to consult the Calendar/Approval Timelines to know important dates and deadlines for these approvals. If you're uncertain, it's recommended to contact the Office of Academic Programs for guidance.",complete,,-0.21478402614593506,5,2,"Only programs require external approvals (the President,Board of Trustees (BoT),SACS,and CHE notification or approval),as outline in ACAF 2.00: ""All new academic programs and program name changes across the entire USC system must be approved by the president.

41,What does each drop/add/w date mean? Will I still get money back for dropped classes?,"The drop/add period is a specific time frame during which undergraduate students can add or remove courses from their schedule through Self Service Carolina. It starts on the official first day of the course and continues for a minimum of 6% of the Part of Term 1 in which the course is scheduled. If you drop a course during this period, it won't be recorded on your transcript.

The withdrawal period allows undergraduate students to withdraw from a course with no grade penalty through Self Service Carolina. This period begins after the free drop/add period and extends to a minimum of 72% of the Part of Term 1 in which the course is scheduled. When you withdraw during this period, the course will be recorded on your transcript with a 'W', but it won't affect your grade point average, earned hours, or graded hours.

The withdrawal fail period enables undergraduate students to withdraw from a course with a penalty grade through Self Service Carolina. This period starts after the withdrawal period and goes through the last day of class for the part of term 1 in which the course is scheduled. If you withdraw during this period, the course will be marked as an 'WF', which is treated as an 'F' in the evaluation of academic standing, computation of grade point average, and graded hours.

Regarding getting money back for dropped classes, if you drop a course within the scheduled refund period, you can expect to receive a refund in approximately four to six weeks. However, if you have any financial obligations to the University, these amounts will be deducted from any refund due. Refunds for students who received and used financial aid to pay academic fees may be applied toward repayment of financial aid. Students who have long-term loans through the University must contact the Student Loan Accounting Office for an exit interview to avoid holds being placed on transcripts.",complete,,3.8759040606282924,5,5,"The last day of drop/add is the last day you can drop a class without being assigned a W. While a W doesn't affect your GPA,financial aid and academic progression standards require that you earn a certain number of hours each year. After the W date,you'll earn an F for each course you drop. Talk with your adviser and financial aid counselor before you make changes to your schedule.

If the class is open to all students but still unavailable, try finding an open section or checking if the department provides online forms for seat notifications. You can also use apps like Coursicle to track course enrollment and receive notifications when a seat becomes available.

If you require a pre- or co-requisite override or need to take a placement test, contact the specific department to see if overrides can be granted. Make sure to complete any necessary forms or tests before attempting to enroll in the class.

Lastly, if you have already taken the prerequisite course but it's not reflected in your record, ensure the Admissions Office has received proof of completion. USC may not accept external credits for certain courses, so double-check the USC policy on transferring credits.
