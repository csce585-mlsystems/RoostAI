If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, a course change proposal must be submitted in APPS with the Carolina Core information completed. Integrative Course Proposals An Integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. As a result, regulatory oversight is ceded predominantly to the academic unit. A department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporates one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes such that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course.

It has 10 Core components, each with learning outcomes and credit hour requirements. The Core begins with foundational courses early in the undergraduate experience, followed by one or more integrative courses near the end in which selected Core learning outcomes are integrated into the chosen major. Each of the ten Core components must be met with a Core-approved course. While most Core-approved courses fulfill a single Core component, a few courses, called overlay-eligible courses, have been approved to fulfill two Core components. Every student is required to complete a minimum of 31 credit hours of Core-approved courses. Transfer students who enter USC Columbia, Lancaster, Salkehatchie, Sumter, or Union are subject to the Carolina Core requirements. Any transfer courses that equate to Carolina Core courses will equate to both content and all outcomes associated with the USC Course.

2,Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,"['to update the student’s record. Curriculum changes can affect loan deferment, scholarship eligibility, athletic participation eligibility, tuition and fee assessment, and international student VISA regulations. For this reason, all curriculum changes must be completed before the end of the free drop/add period in Fall and Spring Terms (in Part of Term 30), and prior to June 1 during the Summer Term. Curriculum change requests that arrive at the Office of the University Registrar after these deadlines will be processed for the following term. Exceptions to this rule may be made in the event that a change request is being made in the semester that student is graduating from the University. Course Substitutions Only under unavoidable and exceptional circumstances will the faculty permit substitution for or exemption from the prescribed curricula. When it becomes necessary to request a deviation from the prescribed course of study, students should consult the dean of their college or the head of the department in which they are majoring before preparing a petition listing the substitutions or exemptions sought and the reasons for the request. Petitions are submitted on forms obtainable from the Scholastic Standards and Petitions Committee of the particular college, and must be returned to the dean of the college in which the student is enrolled. Deviations from degree requirements published in the bulletin must be approved by the student’s dean and the head of the student’s major department. The Scholastic Standards and Petitions Committee of each college functions as an appeal board in cases where agreement between the dean, department head, and the student cannot be reached. Course and Academic Credit Policies Course Numbering Courses numbered from 101 to 699 are available at different levels for undergraduate credit. Courses numbered from 700 to 899 may be taken for graduate credit only and are described in the Graduate Studies Bulletin . All courses numbered from 101 to 499 are for four-year baccalaureate degree candidates. Courses numbered from 500 to 699 may be taken by advanced undergraduate and graduate students for undergraduate or graduate credit, respectively. A 500- to 600-level course taken for undergraduate credit cannot later be awarded graduate credit. Course Credit The credit value of each course is usually determined by the amount of formal instructional time per week for one semester. At least 700 minutes of instruction (and at least twice that for laboratory time) can be expected per credit hour. The semester hour credit for each course is included in each course description. No student suspended from the University of South Carolina for any reason may earn academic credit during the period of suspension, whether by residence elsewhere or by correspondence courses of any origin. Remedial courses (courses numbered 100 or below) may not be used to meet degree requirements. Credit by Examination Currently enrolled students may obtain credit by examination in a course in which they have had no class attendance or semester standing; permission must, however, be obtained from the dean of the college or department chair in which the course is offered. A grade of not less than B on the examination is necessary in order to receive credit for the course. Examinations are not permitted in courses in which a student previously has been enrolled regularly or as an auditor. The applicant must pay to the Office of Financial Services in advance of the examination a fee of $25 per semester hour; this fee is not refundable. The Office of Financial Services will issue a receipt which must be shown to the head of the department conducting the examination, who shall immediately report the results of the examination to the Office of the University Registrar. Credits earned under this regulation are recorded with hours earned only. Transfer Credit Students transferring to the University from another college or university must,before enrolling in class at the University, have their transcripts evaluated by the University. It is only in the light of such evaluation that students will know definitively the transferability and equivalency of each transfer course. Degree applicability will be determined by the college or school in which the student is enrolled. Transferability refers to the conditions under which the University accepts credit for inclusion in the student’s record. Transfer courses must have been taken at a regionally accredited post - secondary institution, or, if taken at a foreign post-secondary institution, have been recommended by a NACES - member external evaluation service. Exceptions to this rule may be made by the Office of the Registrar when state scholarship eligibility rules require inclusion. Equivalency entails equating transfer credit, both in hours and content, to University of South Carolina coursework. The Registrar’s Office works with USC colleges and schools to coordinate the process of transfer evaluation to equate transfer courses directly to courses in the USC course catalog; to subject codes which represent subjects not offered at USC; or to subject codes that identify courses as remedial/technical/non-accredited coursework. A list of transfer equivalencies for the Columbia catalog of courses can be found here(http://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/transfer_credits/course_equivalency.php) . Applicability of credit toward a degree refers to the prerogative of']","When curriculum changes are made to a cross-listed course, those changes typically affect all cross-listed courses as well. This is because cross-listed courses are essentially different academic departments offering the same course. However, there might be specific exceptions depending on individual agreements between departments. In such cases, the dean of the college or the head of the department in which the course is majoring would need to be consulted for clarification.",Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Getting approval for distributed learning for one cross-listed course does not automatically approve cross listed courses for distributed learning delivery.

Minor (18 hours) In place of the cognate a student in the College of Arts and Sciences may choose a minor consisting of at least 18 credit hours of prescribed courses. The minor is intended to develop a coherent basic preparation in a second area of study. It differs from the cognate inasmuch as the courses must follow a structured sequence. Courses applied toward general education requirements cannot be counted toward the minor. No course may satisfy both major and minor requirements. All minor courses must be passed with a grade of C or higher. At least half of the courses in the minor must be completed in residence at the University.

If you answer YES to any of the following, it needs approval through USCeRA. Is this an institutional grant? Does it require a budget? Does it need a University of South Carolina (USC) Authorized Signature? When is my proposal due in USCeRA and the submission software? Arnold School of Public Health (ASPH) requires completed proposals to be entered in USCeRA and the submission software of your choice 7 business days before the sponsor’s or submitting institution’s deadline. Example: If your proposal is due to the sponsor on Friday at 5 p.m., you must submit a completed, ready-to-review proposal to USC by 5 p.m. on Wednesday the week before. What is due to the Office of Research (OoR) 7 business days before the sponsor deadline? To comply, a completed proposal must be loaded in USCeRA, and the submission software must be ready for review. A PI may still tweak the Aims and Research Strategy sections during review, but all other areas of the proposal must be complete. Can I work on my research strategy and aims pages during the 7-day review? Yes, you can continue working on these up until submission. I am collaborating with another institution, and I am the PI (USC is the primary submitter) on the project. What steps and forms/files does the institution need to provide in USCeRA? In USCeRA, while completing the PAP (Proposal/Award Processing form), answer the collaboration questions under the “Funding” section. Then, under the “Questions” section (last section), click yes to question number 5 (Sole source considerations: subcontracts, outside consultants, equipment?) and complete the sole source certification that will pop up under “My Forms” after the PAP form is completed. NOTE: complete ONE certification for EACH collaborating institution (i.e., 3 collaborating institutions = 3 certification forms).

11,What are the requirements for a syllabus?,"['structures. A primary purpose of a syllabus is to communicate to your students what the course is about, why it is taught, where it is going, and what will be required for them to complete the course with a passing grade. Because students will view your syllabus as a kind of ""contract,"" it is important to be as clear as possible, and to avoid changing major aspects of the syllabus after the first day of class. View Steps to a Good Syllabus,(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/syllabus_templates/good_syllabus_steps/index.php) Syllabus Best Practices,(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/syllabus_templates/templates/summer_2021/cte_syllabus_best_practices.pdf) and Syllabus Templates(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/syllabus_templates/index.php) on the Center for Teaching Excellence’s website for additional information on creating a quality syllabus. The syllabus clearly outlines academic integrity expectations. Safeguarding academic integrity in the online environment is essential. It is important to minimize the potential for academic integrity violations. Your syllabus should clearly outline academic integrity expectations. Below are some suggestions: The design of assessments should minimize opportunities for academic integrity violations (e.g., by use of date/time restrictions, randomized questions, Respondus Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor for timed tests, ProctorU, SafeAssign for graded written work). Include a clear policy on acceptable use of social media as it relates to course content. Create a clear policy on the dissemination of course materials and assignments external to the course environment. Include course requirements for students to demonstrate understanding of Academic Integrity expectations (e.g., complete an academic integrity quiz, sign an Honor Code agreement, etc.) Highlight the need for students to report academic integrity violations that are not their own to avoid complicity. Include specific penalties for not adhering to academic integrity expectations.

In deciding what to include in the syllabus, first include all information that students need to have at the beginning of the course. Second, include all information that students need to have in writing. There is no hard-and-fast rule about the proper length for a syllabus. If in doubt, it is usually best to err on the long side, to ensure that important course information is fully covered. At the same time, students will appreciate having key information in succinct form on the first page. Expand all 1. Get Started Before you start writing your syllabus, think first and foremost about the knowledge and skills students should gain in your course, then about how you will assess these knowledge and skills, and finally about the best ways for the students to learn them. Focusing on learning outcomes, rather than a list of topics to cover, generally results in a more satisfying course for you and your students. Organize the syllabus logically, and use consistent (underlined or bold-faced headings) to help students find information. We recommended that the syllabus be created in three main parts: (1) Course Description, (2) Course Outline, and (3) Policies and Procedures. Creating each of these parts separately gives you a set of three documents that can be easily adapted or directly reused for other courses taught 2. The Course Overview Section The course description components of the syllabus should not be changed during the running of the course.

13,What is an integrative course?,"['program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns. Carolina Core Courses Designating a foundational course as Carolina Core Designating a course as Carolina Core requires approval by the Carolina Core Committee. For a new course submitted in APPS, complete the Carolina Core information. If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, a course change proposal must be submitted in APPS with the Carolina Core information completed. Integrative Course Proposals An Integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. As a result, regulatory oversight is ceded predominantly to the academic unit. A department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporates one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes such that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course. The following is the process to designate or delete an Integrative course. Add an Integrative Course Submit a new course proposal or course change proposal as appropriate in APPS.

Integrative learning at USC is about making connections across within and beyond the classroom experiences and includes student engagement in community service, research, peer leadership, internships, and study abroad. Integrative learning is more than just having the experience though and also includes learning from the experience and connecting learning to academic study. The final step is applying learning to solve problems and make decisions . . . applying learning to lead. USC students’ educational experiences are enriched by engagement within and beyond the classroom and their ability to connect these experiences is the heart of a truly meaningful education. CIEL promotes student opportunities to engage beyond the classroom and synthesize and apply learning across experiences. Graduation with Leadership Distinction is the Center’s signature program and recognizes students for significant engagement and learning, including leadership through solution-oriented thinking. Experiential Learning is also encouraged for all undergraduate students. Mission To advance integrative and experiential learning across within and beyond the classroom experiences at the University of South Carolina Columbia and Palmetto College campuses for students, faculty, and staff by providing programs, developing resources, conducting outreach, and facilitating assessment. Vision To foster an enriched educational environment through purposeful within and beyond the classroom experiences that deepen the impact on student learning and enhance their preparation for the future.

What is Navigate? EAB Navigate is one of the four advising technologies used on the USC Columbia campus. It is heavily utilized as the primary scheduling platform for academic advising appointments, as well as for nearly two dozen student service offices around campus. The original platform is intended to guide the prioritization of outreach to and interaction with students based on risk levels and success marker flags. The success markers are established by each department based on the courses that are most predictive of success in each major over time using USC historic student data, or based on critical courses from major maps. These involve both threshold grades in key courses and the timing of those courses. Risk levels are based on student performance and characteristics relative to other students who have graduated in the particular major. Success markers, risk levels, and student characteristics (GPA ranges, class level, department, college, native/transfer, etc.) can be used to quickly query lists of students who may need further assistance. EAB Navigate for Scheduling - Academic Units The list below includes all colleges, departments, and advising units currently utilizing EAB Navigate for scheduling their appointments with students. The column for EAB: Scheduling indicates the method the department/college is using to meet with students, whereas the EAB: Advisor Notes column indicates if the advisors are uploading or recording notes in the software.

The process for course actions at the University of South Carolina involves several steps. To propose a new course, you need approval from the Unit Head, College/School Representative, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. The proposal should be submitted through APPS, and the Curricula and Courses committee or Faculty Senate or Graduate Council might request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns.

For changing an existing course, you also require approval from the Unit Head, Office of Distributed Learning (if adding DL delivery), College/School Representative, Carolina Core Committee (if changing to or adding a Carolina Core course), and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Changes may include various aspects like hours, bulletin description, or pre-requisites. Proposals for course changes are submitted in APPS, with possible program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns.

Lastly, terminating a course requires approval from the Department, College Representative, Curricula and Courses/Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Proposals for course termination are submitted in APPS, with potential program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns. The Carolina Core Courses can be designated as foundational.",Internal Approvals: Academic Unit Head (Chair) Academic Unit Heads for departments affected by the action (only if needed) Distributed Learning (if new or change DL course) College/School Representative (usually the APL) Undergraduate Dean Instructional Development (if new DL course) Registrar (Banner Validation and Degree Audit) Carolina Core Specialty Team Chair –Carolina Core courses only Curricula and Courses Committee Faculty Senate,0.9999999999,0.6

It is important to minimize the potential for academic integrity violations. Your syllabus should clearly outline academic integrity expectations. Below are some suggestions: The design of assessments should minimize opportunities for academic integrity violations (e.g., by use of date/time restrictions, randomized questions, Respondus Lockdown Browser or Respondus Monitor for timed tests, ProctorU, SafeAssign for graded written work). Include a clear policy on acceptable use of social media as it relates to course content. Create a clear policy on the dissemination of course materials and assignments external to the course environment. Include course requirements for students to demonstrate understanding of Academic Integrity expectations (e.g., complete an academic integrity quiz, sign an Honor Code agreement, etc.) Highlight the need for students to report academic integrity violations that are not their own to avoid complicity.

I’ve submitted my proposal in USCERA, but just realized I made a mistake on one of the forms or uploaded the wrong attachments – can I withdraw my proposal? You cannot withdraw a submitted proposal, but you can contact your unit head and ask them to return the proposal to you. 10. My project includes a stipend for a graduate research assistant, do I have to include funds for tuition in my project budget as well? Yes. Tuition should be included at the current rate per credit hour as shown on the Bursar’s Office webpage. In cases where a sponsor specifically disallows tuition or student fees, you should make a note in your budget justification about how those costs will be covered (from an existing start-up or research incentive fund). Grant budgets including support for graduate research assistants (GRAs) should also include funds to cover the cost of GRA health insurance, using published student health insurance premiums as a basis for the budget estimate. GRA health insurance costs should be included on the same budget line as GRA tuition, so they are excluded from the modified total direct cost base for calculating indirect costs. Current GRA health insurance premiums are posted here. There is no cost for GRA health insurance during the summer months. 11. The sponsor requires cost share – what documentation do I need to include in USCERA? Unless you have written confirmation that the college (Dean’s office) is providing a cost share, this cost share will typically go under the “Department” section of the USCERA Cost Share form. You will need to discuss this with your department chair/school director and, if appropriate, Associate Dean for Research prior to USCERA submission. If you are cost sharing academic year salary, you should also include the fringe benefits and typically the indirect cost on the sum of salary and fringe to count toward the cost share commitment.

Beginning with the Fall 2013 term, graduate students will visit Self Service Carolina to drop a course. Courses dropped before the drop/add date found on Academic Calendar(http://registrar.sc.edu/html/calendar/5YrCalendar3.stm) (usually within the first week of class) can be dropped without academic or financial penalty. Courses dropped during the second through the sixth week of a regular semester (see date on the Academic Calendar) are recorded with an academic nonpenalty grade of W . After the first six weeks of the semester, any courses dropped will appear on the permanent record with a grade of WF . A WF is treated as an F in the evaluation of the student’s eligibility to continue and is computed into the student’s graduate cumulative grade point average. Graduate students who stop attending a class without officially dropping it remain on the final grade roll and must be assigned a grade by the professor of record. A grade of F is appropriate, unless a higher grade has been earned by partial submission of the required course work, and that assigned grade is included in all calculations and totals. In summer sessions and other shortened terms, the period for withdrawal with a grade of W will be 43 percent of the total number of class days (see date on the Academic Calendar(http://registrar.sc.edu/html/calendar/5YrCalendar3.stm) ). A course cannot be dropped after the last day of classes specified for the session in which the course is scheduled. Students are responsible for consulting the academic calendar for each term in which they are enrolled for the applicable dates. Students should also consult their academic advisor and graduate director for advisement before withdrawing from course work. Dropping a Course for Extenuating Circumstances A student who wishes to drop a course for medical reasons or other acceptable cause after the session penalty date specified on the Academic Calendar for that term (last day to receive a W ), may petition for assignment of W by submitting a Request for Assignment of W for Extenuating Circumstances form (AS-122A) available from the Office of the University Registrar(http://registrar.sc.edu/html/forms/) with the appropriate documentation of circumstances, (e.g., a letter from a physician or health care provider). The petition requires the approval of the student’s graduate director, the instructor of each course, and the dean of The Graduate School. A request for partial reduction (rather than complete) withdrawal for extenuating circumstances must include evidence (i.e., a written statement from a physician, counselor, or other qualified professional; or other documentation of extenuating circumstances) that a reduction in, rather than complete withdrawal from, student course work is appropriate. Students must be aware that liability for repayment of student loans and other financial obligations may apply. Withdrawal from All Courses A student who wishes to withdraw from all courses should consult their academic advisor and graduate director for advisement before withdrawing from course work. The date of withdrawal affects the grades assigned ( W or WF ), as do valid, supported claims of extenuating circumstances (see previous section). If applicable, Form AS-122A available from the Office of the University Registrar(http://registrar.sc.edu/html/forms/) must be approved by the graduate director and a student’s instructors prior to withdrawal. Grades assigned to students who withdraw from all courses are determined in the manner described in the previous section. Students who withdraw should be aware of the ramifications of that action with respect to grades assigned, program status, liability for repayment of student loans, and financial obligations to the University. Financial Obligations to the University Any student withdrawing from the University within the scheduled refund period (see Master Schedule of Classes(https://ssb.onecarolina.sc.edu/BANP/bwckschd.p_disp_dyn_sched) ) can expect to receive a refund in approximately four to six weeks. If, at the time of withdrawal, the student has any financial obligations to the University, these amounts will be deducted from any refund due. Refunds for students who received and used financial aid to pay academic fees may be applied toward repayment of financial aid. Students who have received long-term loans through the University must contact the Student Loan Accounting Office for an exit interview. Failure to participate in this exit interview may result in a hold being placed on transcripts. Grading Policies The letter grades A, B, C, D, and F are employed to designate excellent, good, fair, poor, and failing work, respectively. The grades B+, C+ , and D+ also may be recorded. Courses graded D+ or lower cannot be applied to graduate degree programs. The letter grades S (satisfactory) and U (unsatisfactory) are assigned only in courses that have been approved for Pass-Fail grading or in a standard graded course where the student, with the approval of the dean of The Graduate School, has elected an individual Pass-Fail Option. Courses completed with an S may be counted in total', 'site to avoid cancellation of classes and payment of a late registration fee of $5 per day ($350 maximum).

30,How do I know when my finals are?,"[""Finals Tips: How to ace your finals - USC News & Events | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Finals Tips: How to ace your finals Posted on: November 24, 2021; Updated on: November 24, 2021 By Cam Adams, stucomm@mailbox.sc.edu With finals just around the corner, you may be feeling a bit stressed. Lauren Brown of the Student Success Center has helped us put together a list of tips to guide you through the most stressful time of the year. Come up with a study plan Before hitting the books, you need to know what to expect for the exam. When and where are your exams? Are your exams cumulative or do they cover the last few weeks? What is the format of your exam? Knowing this information can help you determine how you need to study for each exam and when you need to start studying for each exam. It’s recommended that students spread their studying out seven days before their exam. Brown also advises that students break their studying up into “chunks” within that week. For each chunk, determine what you want to cover, what your study strategy will be and the amount of time you’ll need. Once you get to the day before the exam, you should do a general review of the material with a focus on your weakest areas. Lastly, study smarter, not harder. Once you get back from Thanksgiving break, you should start to implement your study plan. Use campus resources Another way to study effectively for finals is to make use of campus resources. The Student Success Center can be your go-to for all of your finals needs. In partnership with Russell House, the center will be hosting over 50 two-hour finals review sessions starting Dec. 4 and running through the remainder of finals week. Students can also drop into Russell House for tutoring between Dec. 1 and 4, and schedule one-on-one appointments on the Mezzanine level of the Thomas Cooper Library beginning Dec. 6. More info on these resources can be found on the student success center website . Remember to take care of yourself Although finals week is a very important time of the semester, it’s also important to take care of yourself and prioritize your mental health. Remember to take periodic breaks throughout your study time as it allows your mind to reset. It is also important to remember to get a good night’s sleep, giving your brain the rest it needs to ace your finals. Share this Story!

The policy does not specifically require final examinations. The whole point of having an exam schedule is so that multiple classes are not scheduled for finals in the same space. When can a course instructor administer a final exam? As stated in the USC Faculty Manual (p. 54): In any course or laboratory that meets weekly, no quiz, test, or examination shall be given during the last class session before the regular examination period. In any course or laboratory that meets two or three times a week, no quiz, test, or examination shall be given during the last two class sessions before the regular examination period. In any course or laboratory that meets more than three times a week, no quiz, test, or examination shall be given during the last three sessions before the regular examination period. Additionally, the start times for final examinations and their duration are posted on the Registrar’s Final Exams webpage. I don\'t see anything on the Registrar\'s site for my class meeting time. So, when should I schedule my final exam or assessment? Most likely your class meets at a ""nonstandard"" time. You should contact the Registrar’s Office for a date and time. A staff member will advise you of a date and time that does not conflict with the established schedule. I want to give an online exam, but my designated finals day is the first day of finals week. How do I give ""ample time"" without using class periods during the week before Reading Day? Provide access to the exam after the last class meeting and make the due date at midnight on the first day of exams. However, most online final exams consist of multiple choice and would require 24 hours or less to determine the final grades. The key is that you cannot have the due date on Reading Day or during the last few classes. What if my students or I want to deviate from the day and time that the Registrar’s Office posts for the final exam? You must adhere to the schedule posted on the Registrar’s Final Exams webpage. Deviations may create conflicts for students with']","To find out when your finals are, check the University of South Carolina's Registrar's Final Exams webpage.

The registration system will let you register for courses if you are enrolled in the prerequisite course at USC at the time you register. If you do not get the required grade in the course you are taking, you will need to adjust your schedule prior to the start of the next term. If you do not make appropriate changes yourself, you will be dropped from the next course when it is noted that you do not meet the prerequisite. I took the required course elsewhere, but it isn't on my record yet. This can happen if you have taken a course outside the USC system, including AP Calculus or IB Mathematics. It is up to you, and not the Mathematics Department, to make sure that the Admissions Office receives the courses you have taken so that you can register for the courses you want. Note that there are certain instances when courses will not transfer. For example, USC policy does not allow you to get credit for a course from outside the USC system if you have already attempted the course inside the USC system. If you are waiting for scores to be transferred and need an override to register, please submit an override application . Why can't I take MATH 141 after taking MATH 122? The confusion here seems to stem from students thinking that higher numbered courses mean that the student has mastered the material in lower numbered courses. But this is not the case.

First, check if there's a registration restriction by viewing the course information on the classes.sc.edu website or using the ""How to Identify Class Registration Restrictions"" video guide. You might find that the class is reserved for specific student populations or has pre- or co-requisites.

If the class is open to all students but still unavailable, try finding an open section or checking if the department provides online forms for seat notifications. You can also use apps like Coursicle to track course enrollment and receive notifications when a seat becomes available.

If you require a pre- or co-requisite override or need to take a placement test, contact the specific department to see if overrides can be granted. Make sure to complete any necessary forms or tests before attempting to enroll in the class.

Lastly, if you have already taken the prerequisite course but it's not reflected in your record, ensure the Admissions Office has received proof of completion. USC may not accept external credits for certain courses, so double-check the USC policy on transferring credits.

In summary, carefully review the context provided to identify the issue and follow the suggested steps to resolve your enrollment problem.

Q: Should late applicants contact you before they apply? A: Definitely. In fact, before hitting submit on your application, we highly recommend making a call to us. If you think you’re a match for our program, we want to hear from you right away. With such a tight timeframe on late applications, your call establishes a connection that helps us smooth the admissions process. We can advise you on how to get all of your application pieces together quickly and in the proper format. On the flip side, if we don’t see any path in the coming year, we’ll be honest with you. Q: If an applicant isn’t admissible for an upcoming term, can they be considered for the next one? A: We often see late applicants who would have been admitted and awarded scholarships if they’d applied earlier. If that’s the case for you, we’ll work with you to move your application to an upcoming term. As an early applicant, you’ll be among the first to be reviewed and have the benefit of ongoing access to our team as you refine your application for admissions. For some late applicants, we can event offer automatic admissions to the next class intake. Q: Any last thoughts for late applicants? A: Yes, go ahead and apply! If you have an amazing background and strong credentials, we’d like to make room for you in this year’s class. One last thought is to remember', ""admission? The waiting list is a status in a candidate's file rather than an enumerated list. Admitted candidates will withdraw as they commit to other schools, and we will periodically notify candidates if it appears unlikely we will be able to offer them admission. There is no typical number accepted from the waiting list; it has varied from a few to 10 percent or more of the entering class. When can I expect to hear something? We depend on admitted candidates to notify us of their intentions, so we cannot predict when seats may become available. We will invite candidates to remain in consideration for available seats from January through June if necessary. If you have not heard from us, you are still on the waiting list. Feel free to call the Admissions Office at any time to ask for an update on our admission process. Because of our required pre-enrollment steps, few offers of admission are extended after late July. How will I know when an offer of admission is available? If an offer of admission is authorized for you, a member of our Admissions team will telephone or email you to discuss the opportunity before an offer is made. How will my waiting list status affect my chances of receiving financial aid? We acknowledge that the cost of tuition is an important factor in your decision to attend law school. Scholarship funds vary throughout the admission process. The Admissions team continues to assess the availability of funds on a daily basis. The Admissions team will notify you should additional funds become available upon admission.

Joint Degree Program: an arrangement in which one diploma is issued representing both institutions. The academic program is offered jointly by both institutions. Depending on the program, notification and/or approval is required from CHE and/or SACS. The university does not currently offer any joint degree programs with international partners. Dual Degree Program: an agreement in which the two institutions involved each awards a separate degree to the student. Essentially, the student works to complete coursework at both institutions, and through a series of approved credit transfers, fulfills the requirements of each institution’s degree.

Qualified students can take courses that count toward both undergraduate and graduate degrees, reducing the time and cost to earn the graduate degree. How does it work? Qualified undergraduate students can earn up to 12 credit hours of graduate-level classes while still an undergraduate through the Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan. Here's how it works: Classes must be 500-level and above Classes must be taken for graduate credit through the application process described below Classes can be applied to your baccalaureate program and, with graduate program admission and approval, applied to your graduate program of study The use of dual credit can reduce the total time to earn both the undergraduate and graduate degrees. You can also use your undergraduate financial aid to pay for the dual credit courses. What graduate programs are available? While our five-year bachelor’s/master’s programs of study are popular, all of our graduate certificates, master’s degrees and Ph.D. programs are eligible for inclusion in an Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan. For specifics on our offerings, visit our Graduate Programs page. Who is eligible? You will need to have earned at least 90 hours of undergraduate coursework and have a minimum GPA of 3.4 to formally apply for this program. However, we encourage engineering and computing students to start planning, with your advisor’s help, before your junior year. Note that you don’t need to be pursuing an undergraduate degree from the Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing to start in one of our accelerated graduate programs. Of course, classes taken for dual credit must be degree-applicable for both your undergraduate degree and your intended graduate program of study. When both are in the same or similar discipline, it is easy to earn up to 12 hours of dual credit. We want you to be able to earn as much dual credit as possible, so please discuss the Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan with your advisor prior to taking your engineering, computing and technical electives and other 500-level classes that may be available for dual credit. You need to initially register for such classes for graduate credit for them to count, as graduate credit cannot be awarded retroactively. How do I apply? You will need to submit an initial application before registering for your first class in this program, and then again prior to each semester that you want to earn dual credit for a class. It is not complicated.

Will I receive honors credit for my AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses? Most of our students earn college credit before graduating from high school. Credits earned via AP/IB/Cambridge tests or dual-enrollment are not counted toward honors requirements, but they do count towards the Carolina Core, as appropriate(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/undergraduate_admissions/requirements/for_freshmen/ap_ib_credits/) . These credits often serve as pre-requisites for upper-level courses and can allow room in your course of study for higher-level courses. You can discuss your options with your advisor. Why don't you accept AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses for Honors? The premise of an AP/IB or dual-enrollment course is that it is equivalent to a college course.

Charleston Mayor Joe Riley, who is retiring this year after leading the city since 1975, will deliver the commencement address. As students walk across the stage Monday for the final commencement of 2015, the university completes a record year for the number of students earning Graduation with Leadership Distinction on their diplomas. Nearly 40 students at the December commencement will receive the GLD honor, bringing the total of 2015 graduates to 248. These students engage in beyond-the-classroom learning, document their activities and reflect on their overall college experiences in an e-portfolio. The honor is posted on transcripts and diplomas, which can help as they apply to graduate schools or enter the job market. In 2014, there were 105 graduates with leadership distinction. Irma Van Scoy , director of USC Connect, says most students initially pursue the GLD because they want the recognition on their transcript and diploma. ""That\'s what gets them interested, but by the time they finish the process, they can really articulate the significance of their undergraduate education — what they have learned in class and out of class,"" Van Scoy says. ""They end up saying, \'This is one of the most valuable things I\'ve done at USC and now I know where I\'m going.\' "" More than 850 Carolina students are now pursuing the GLD recognition, with more than 300 expected to graduate in May 2016. Students in every college and school at the university, along with students from the four Palmetto College campuses, are represented in the program. Van Scoy says the GLD program has helped people understand integrated learning and offers students a chance to take related coursework, demonstrate what they\'ve learned through a presentation, reflect on their undergraduate experience and consider how they will apply learning to lead in the future.

For Distributed Learning Courses Describe what students should expect from the course format. The description may include expectations of an online course versus a face-to-face course, the structure of weekly modules, and an overview of expected learning activities. Sample Language for a Syllabus This is a fully online course. Online classes are not easier than face-to-face lecture classes. To succeed in an online class, you must be extremely motivated and well-organized. You must purchase the required textbook listed above by the first day of the course. Other course materials are available via Blackboard (“Bb”). Regular Internet access is essential for successful completion of the course. The typical class structure will consist of learning modules, which include: Short Video/PowerPoint Lectures Readings Online Discussions Group Projects Video Presentations Exams Field Exercises Written Exercises This is an entirely Web-based course. We have no face-to-face class meetings, and you will complete your work asynchronously – which simply means that you will be working on it at different times than your colleagues. It is important to understand that this is not a self-paced class or an independent study. You will have assigned deadlines, and work must be submitted on time. You may not save up your assignments to complete in the last weeks or days of the semester. One critical part of this class is regular interaction with other students and with me, your instructor. Each assignment sequence must be completed on schedule – you can't work ahead or get behind and be successful. * Course Communication and Feedback Describe the method and turnaround time of course communications and feedback.

For Distributed Learning Courses Describe what students should expect from the course format. The description may include expectations of an online course versus a face-to-face course, the structure of weekly modules, and an overview of expected learning activities. Sample Language for a Syllabus This is a fully online course. Online classes are not easier than face-to-face lecture classes. To succeed in an online class, you must be extremely motivated and well-organized. You must purchase the required textbook listed above by the first day of the course. Other course materials are available via Blackboard (“Bb”). Regular Internet access is essential for successful completion of the course. The typical class structure will consist of learning modules, which include: Short Video/PowerPoint Lectures Readings Online Discussions Group Projects Video Presentations Exams Field Exercises Written Exercises This is an entirely Web-based course. We have no face-to-face class meetings, and you will complete your work asynchronously – which simply means that you will be working on it at different times than your colleagues. It is important to understand that this is not a self-paced class or an independent study. You will have assigned deadlines, and work must be submitted on time. You may not save up your assignments to complete in the last weeks or days of the semester. One critical part of this class is regular interaction with other students and with me, your instructor. Each assignment sequence must be completed on schedule – you can't work ahead or get behind and be successful. * Course Communication and Feedback Describe the method and turnaround time of course communications and feedback.

If you have an immunization hold, you should check the information on the Health Requirements(https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/graduate_school/new_students/health_requirements/index.php) page to make sure you have submitted all required documents. You can also contact the Immunization office from a link on the Health Requirements page.

Students in on-campus or hybrid programs must submit immunization records. If you are in a fully online program, you are eligible to submit the Distance Learner Exemption Form, but you will have to submit it each semester to avoid having an immunization hold. If you have submitted your immunization paperwork and it has been 72 hours since submission, send a secure message in the myhealthspace system to the Allergy, Immunization and Travel Clinic Provider (AIT Provider) to ask that your immunization hold be lifted. You can also check to see if you have received a secure message from the Health Center in myhealthspace. I need to take some time off from my program. What should I do? Students may need to pause in their graduate studies for various reasons. If you do need to take a break at the end of a semester or before a new semester starts, it’s always a good idea to let your faculty advisor know via email and to notify Gamecock EdQuarters at COESTUDY@mailbox.sc.edu about your plans.

MUSC is committed to providing the highest quality health care to students. Our team of medical experts will work with you to enhance your health and well-being and ultimately, help you achieve your personal and academic goals. Will I be charged for Student Health Insurance? Yes. MUSC has a hard waiver requirement. Each semester the insurance charge is added to the accounts of all eligible MUSC students. To be eligible, a student must be enrolled in 6 or more hours and in a degree seeking program. However, if you have creditable insurance coverage from another source, you can complete the online waiver process before the deadline (each semester). Once your waiver information is verified and approved, the insurance charge will be removed from your account. Important: A completed, verified and approved WAIVER is required each semester for students who do not wish to participate in the school sponsored Student Health Insurance Plan. Upon completion of the waiver form, a student will automatically receive an email notifying him/her of a pending waiver. How much does the Student Health Plan cost? The rates vary slightly year to year. Why is the spring premium higher than the fall premium? The fall premium covers August 1-December 31 or 153 days (42% of the year). The spring/summer premium covers January 1 - July 31 or 212 days (58% of the year). Do I need to complete any enrollment forms to enroll in the Student Health Plan? Yes, you need to enroll through the Academic Health Plans website before the coverage period begins to ensure benefits are activated on the first date of the coverage period. Because health insurance is required at MUSC, you will be automatically enrolled and charged if you do not enroll or waive by the deadline given each semester. Waiting for the automatic enrollment process to occur will delay access to benefits. What is meant by a ""hard waiver""? A hard waiver program is one where students must be enrolled in an external verified/approved health insurance plan or in the Student Health Insurance Plan. Each semester, students are required and encouraged to review their enrollment status for the Student Health Insurance Plan. Students have the option of submitting a waiver if the student has coverage from another source and that coverage meets certain criteria. What if I am already covered by insurance and I am charged? During the enrollment/waiver period, students who have adequate health insurance coverage through a parent, spouse, or an individual plan, can waive out of the health insurance requirement by providing proof of insurance coverage in a comparable health insurance plan through the online waiver system. If the student does not waive out of the sponsored plan by the deadline date each semester, he/she will be automatically enrolled in the MUSC Student Health Insurance Plan and billed through Student Accounting. What are MUSC\'s requirements for alternate insurance coverage that would qualify for a waiver? Alternate health insurance plans are reviewed to determine if a plan is comparable to MUSC’s Student Health Insurance Plan. MUSC has identified the following criteria are to be applied in making this determination: Coverage must be effective on or before January 1 (spring) or May 1 (new summer students only) or August 1 (fall) and extend through the semester including breaks and holidays Coverage must be ACA compliant and allow the insured student to receive services in South Carolina (note – these are requirements for all plans according to the Patient Protection Affordable Care Act; online students physically located outside of South Carolina during the semester may be granted an exception if all other criteria are met) See Full List(https://musc.myahpcare.com/waiver) What are the requirements for International Students?

Instead, we use a notification list to inform students when we open more seats for a course—whether it is for an existing section or for a new section. After those on the list are alerted of seat openings for a course, the seats become available on a first come, first served basis - whoever registers first for an open seat will get it. We cannot reserve any seats for individual students. It is therefore important to regularly check your USC email. You should also continue to monitor Self-Service Carolina in the event a seat becomes available because a student drops the course. Please be aware that even if you add your name to the notification list, there is no guarantee that more seats will be opened. Prerequisite Overrides Temporary Prerequisite Override(https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?id=GUsqSzXRDkKLsrHNI4mYzLBknGEz9JNEvqHPSaToYG9UNDYwMjlCTVVWV0pDUEQ5RjFKVlM1MVo3VyQlQCN0PWcu) If you have taken an AP Calculus or IB Mathematics (higher level) test and are waiting for the scores to come to USC to satisfy a prerequisite or if you are waiting for course credit from another College or University in order to satisfy a prerequisite, then complete the prerequisite override form. Faculty can not give overrides of any kind for any reason for any class. FAQs Expand all What if I want to get into a particular section of a course? There is no need to indicate the section you need. We will notify you whenever we create seats for a course, including if we create additional seats in the section you happen to need, whatever it is. When we notify you, you should also be sure to check whether there are new sections created of the course you want that will fit into your schedule. I was signed up for the section that I wanted, and now the instructor changed to a different section that is full? How do I get into the section the instructor is teaching now? We cannot accommodate this. The instructor that is assigned to a section can change or switch at any time prior to the semester or summer session starting. We try to indicate early on for some of the sections who the instructors will be, but there are a number of reasons that the instructors may need to change. We cannot assign a student to a particular instructor. How do I get an override for MATH 300 or for a 500 level MATH course? This is done the same way. Fill out the notification list indicated in the first question above. The only difference is that we may give you an override into the requested course and contact you directly. Note that an override does not register you for the course; you will still need to do that yourself. I saw some open seats, and I wasn't notified about them. What happened? We only notify students for courses when we create seats in them. There are other reasons seats can become available. In particular, if a student drops a section, which is out of our control, a seat will become available, but we will not know and will not notify you. I saw that an override was given for a course that I wanted, but you indicate that doesn't happen. What's up with that? Looks can be deceiving. Sometimes caps (the number of seats available in a course) are lowered (for example, to help us balance enrollments in different sections). This will cause an appearance that overrides were given. Also, enrollments in courses taught through the South Carolina Honors College or the Opportunities Scholars' Program are not handled through the Mathematics Department, even though they may be mathematics courses. We do not control how registration is handled for these, and overrides for students in these programs may occur for these courses. Challenge the conventional. Create the exceptional.

The only grades assigned on courses taken under the Pass-Fail option are S and U; a grade of S indicates satisfactory performance, a grade of U indicates unsatisfactory progress. A student will be given credit for courses in which the grade of S is earned, but these courses will not affect the computation of the grade point average. Specific provisions of the Pass-Fail program are as follows: The Pass-Fail grading system is in effect for an indefinite period of time, subject to periodic review. The Pass-Fail option is not available to undergraduate students whose semester or cumulative GPA is less than 2.00. Students are permitted to exercise the Pass-Fail option only on free elective courses. Students are permitted to take no more than eight courses on a Pass-Fail basis during their undergraduate career. A student wishing to exercise the option must have the permission of the dean of the college and the student’s academic advisor. The Pass-Fail Option form (AS-20) is used for this purpose. The option may be elected or revoked by the student no later than the last date for withdrawing from the course without a penalty. Normal prerequisites may be waived for students taking a course on a Pass-Fail basis. Courses taken under this option will be excluded from the calculation of the grade point average. A grade of S will be entered by the Office of the University Registrar for a regularly assigned passing grade; a failing grade will be registered as U. No course carried on a Pass-Fail basis will be counted toward the hours required for either the President’s or the Dean’s Honor List. A verified learning-disabled student may take on a Pass-Fail basis an elective or required course which is not in the major if the academic advisory plan so recommends the Pass-Fail option for that course. A student who desires use of this option must apply to the dean of the college at the beginning of the semester. With the approval of the academic dean, learning-disabled students may meet specific degree requirements with a satisfactory grade. Spring 2020 Undergraduate Pass-Fail Grading Approved by the USC Faculty Senate on April 1, 2020 To address complications presented by the COVID19 pandemic, the Faculty Senate Steering Committee approved the following grading accommodations for undergraduate students enrolled in Spring 2020. All courses will be graded as originally planned according to grading criteria in course syllabi. After grades are submitted at the end of the semester, undergraduates can choose, on a course-by-course basis, to request a pass/fail grade for the Spring 2020 semester with the exception of Graduate or professional school courses, which can be taken as pass/fail only when deemed appropriate by the program or school Dean. The following pass/fail scale will be used: Earned grades of A, B+, B, C+, and C will be replaced with SC, earned grades of D+ and D will be replaced with S, and an earned grade of F will be replaced with U. If students select the S+/S/U grading scale for a course, points will not be factored into the GPA. Courses with S+ and S will count towards earned semester hours. Courses graded with the S+/S/U scale, under this exception for Spring 2020, will count towards applicable curricular, major, continuation, and graduation requirements. For example, if a course requires a C or better in a prerequisite, students selecting this alternative grading scale would need an S+ in the prerequisite course. Faculty members will not be aware of students who select the pass/fail grading option when entering final grades. Grades will be entered in the format for which the course was approved. Students who previously decided to take a course on a pass/fail basis will continue on a pass/fail basis using the University’s established S/U system (e.g., S is earned if the grade is D or above', 'of F or to the back-up grade indicated by the faculty member on the Assignment of Incomplete Grade form. T , a Graduate School symbol, is assigned to indicate enrollment in Thesis Preparation (799) and Dissertation Preparation (899). Courses with this symbol will be counted as hours attempted and hours earned only. Grade points will not be awarded. For unsatisfactory work the grade of U should be assigned. The grade of I cannot be assigned in courses numbered 799 and 899. AUD indicates a course was carried on an audit basis. (See section on “Auditing” for more information.) NR , No Record, is assigned in the event that the grade is not available at the time final grades are submitted. It is a temporary mark on the transcript and must be replaced by a grade. If replacement does not occur before the last week of the spring or fall semester following the term for which the grade was recorded, a grade of F will be assigned. The NR is ignored in computing the GPA.

Spring 2020 Undergraduate Pass-Fail Grading Approved by the USC Faculty Senate on April 1, 2020 To address complications presented by the COVID19 pandemic, the Faculty Senate Steering Committee approved the following grading accommodations for undergraduate students enrolled in Spring 2020. All courses will be graded as originally planned according to grading criteria in course syllabi. After grades are submitted at the end of the semester, undergraduates can choose, on a course-by-course basis, to request a pass/fail grade for the Spring 2020 semester with the exception of Graduate or professional school courses, which can be taken as pass/fail only when deemed appropriate by the program or school Dean. The following pass/fail scale will be used: Earned grades of A, B+, B, C+, and C will be replaced with S+, earned grades of D+ and D will be replaced with S, and an earned grade of F will be replaced with U. If students select the S+/S/U grading scale for a course, points will not be factored into the GPA. Courses with S+ and S will count towards earned semester hours. Courses graded with the S+/S/U scale, under this exception for Spring 2020, will count towards applicable curricular, major, continuation, and graduation requirements. For example, if a course requires a C or better in a prerequisite, students selecting this alternative grading scale would need an S+ in the prerequisite course. Faculty members will not be aware of students who select the pass/fail grading option when entering final grades. Grades will be entered in the format for which the course was approved. Students who previously decided to', ') form for approval. The Graduate School does not approve the make-up of I grades in courses which are already out-of-date for use on a student’s program of study or extensions of time without sufficient justification and/or supporting documentation. Graduate students cannot register for additional coursework if there are 3 or more temporary grades of incomplete (I) that have not yet been replaced with a permanent grade on their academic record. Student enrolled in graduate study may not graduate with a temporary grade of I on their record, even if that course is not listed on the Program of Study. NR (no record) is a temporary mark on the transcript assigned by the Office of the University Registrar if a grade has not been submitted by the instructor at the proper time or if any grade not approved for a particular course has been submitted. As a temporary mark on the transcript the NR must be replaced by a grade. If the NR is not resolved or replaced by the instructor with a valid end-of-term grade before the end of the major (Fall or Spring) term following the term for which the grade of NR was recorded, a grade of F will be assigned. Pass-Fail Option Unless there is an academic program exception explicitly approved by the Graduate Council, a graduate student may elect Pass-Fail grading in a course only if the content is outside the student’s major area of study and is not required on the program of study. This option permits enrichment of the student’s learning experience and a grade of either S (satisfactory) or U (unsatisfactory) will be awarded. Courses completed with a satisfactory grade may be counted toward total credit hours earned. A grade of U received under the individual Pass-Fail Option will be calculated into the cumulative grade point average as a grade of F . Students must have the approval of their academic program advisor and the dean of The Graduate School prior to registration. Academic Standard for Grade Point Average The cumulative grade point average (GPA) is defined as the GPA of all graduate credit courses recorded on the official USC transcript. In-date courses are ten or fewer years old for doctoral students and six or less years old for Master’s, specialist, graduate certificate, and nondegree students. Revalidated courses are also included in the cumulative GPA calculation. Grades earned for graduate credits transferred from other colleges or universities are not included in the cumulative GPA. Academic Standard for Progression Graduate courses may be passed for degree credit with a grade as low as C, but a degree-seeking student must maintain at least a B (3.00 on a 4.00 scale) cumulative grade point average. Some programs stipulate that no grade below B can be applied to a core course. Programs may cancel a student’s registration privilege if the student fails to make adequate progress toward degree as defined by the program’s academic policies. A student’s registration privileges may also be cancelled for failure to meet academic standards as defined by The Graduate School. Academic Standard for Graduation At the time of graduation, the student’s graduate cumulative grade point average (GPA) must be at least 3.00 ( B ) on a 4.00 scale. Additionally, the student’s average on all grades recorded on the program of study for courses numbered 700 or above must be at least 3.00 and all courses listed on the program of study must be at least 3.00. Academic Suspension Policy Graduate degree-seeking students whose cumulative grade point average (GPA) drops below 3.00 ( B ) will be placed on academic probation by The Graduate School and allowed one calendar year in which to raise the cumulative GPA to at least 3.00. In the case of conversion of grades of incomplete that cause a cumulative GPA to drop below 3.00, a degree-seeking student will be placed on academic probation at the end of the semester in which the grade is posted. Students whose cumulative GPA falls below the required minimum of 3.00 by receiving a grade for a course in which they received a grade of Incomplete will, instead of a one-year probationary period, be granted only one major semester of probation dating from the semester in which the Incomplete conversion grade is received by the registrar in which to raise their cumulative GPA to 3.00 or above. Students who do not reach a cumulative 3.00 grade point average during the probationary period will be suspended from graduate study and will not be permitted to enroll for further graduate course work as a degree or a nondegree student. Colleges, schools, and/or departments may have a more stringent policy than The Graduate School’s academic suspension policy. Students are also responsible for knowing program policies. Reinstatement After Suspension The Graduate School’s Policy on Academic Probation and Suspension stipulates that when a degree-seeking graduate student’s cumulative graduate grade point average (GPA) falls below 3.0 the student is placed on academic probation. The student has one calendar year, or in the case of an Incomplete conversion one major term,', 'reading lists no fewer than 90 days prior to the start of the exam. Each committee member is responsible for evaluating written exam responses corresponding with his/her area of expertise within two weeks of the student’s completion of the written exam. Each committee member will assign a grade of Pass, Conditional Pass, or Fail. A Conditional Pass or Fail indicates that a student must undertake remedial work on the exam response. The committee may allow a maximum of one month for the student to complete any remediation. Committee members will have a maximum of two weeks to evaluate the remediated work as Pass or Fail. Students have one opportunity to complete remedial work and must pass every section of the written comprehensive exam in order to pass the exam as a whole. Dissertation Committee The dissertation committee must include no fewer than four members and must include one (but no more than one) member from outside USC Geography. Regular and research faculty who have been appointed to associate membership of the USC Graduate Faculty may also serve on or chair a doctoral committee. Faculty members with term appointments may serve on, but may not chair, doctoral committees. The dissertation committee may or may not have the same members as the comprehensive examination committee. Format Dissertations may be traditional or manuscript style. Manuscript style dissertations must consist at least three manuscripts prepared for, but not necessarily accepted for, publication. The student must be senior author on all three manuscripts. All dissertations must follow the formatting guidelines defined by the Graduate School. Defense The student will submit a complete draft of the dissertation to the committee at least two weeks prior to the defense. The dissertation must be placed in the department office at least one week prior to the defense. The defense will be open to the public and typically involves a short (~30 minute) public talk with questions and answers, followed by a closed session with the dissertation committee. The dissertation defense should be no fewer than 30 days before graduation date. The committee may allow one month for a student to complete any required remediation. Students have only one opportunity to complete the remediation. Teaching Experience All students must have at least one semester’s worth of experience as an instructor of record or as a laboratory instructor. Full-Length Research Presentation All students shall present a 35-45 minute public research presentation. This is a separate requirement (and presentation topic) from the dissertation defense. Academic Progress Probation Students must demonstrate satisfactory academic progress at the end of each semester. Students who receive a grade lower than a “B” in a graduate course or who do not demonstrate satisfactory academic progress will be placed on academic probation for one academic semester. Students on probation may lose their funding. Termination Causes for termination may include, but are not limited to, the following: Failure to complete all requirements from the previous degree by the end of the first semester. Failure to have an academic advisor at all times. Receiving two grades lower than a “B” in graduate courses. Academic dishonesty. Failure of the written comprehensive exam. Failure to have an approved dissertation proposal by the end of the fifth regular semester for full-time students. Failure to produce a defensible dissertation.

Accelerated Graduation by Attending Two Summer Sessions. Normally, students will obtain residence credit for the fall and spring semesters of each of their three years of law school and graduate in May of their third year. Students may elect, however, to accelerate their graduation by one semester (graduating in December of their third year rather than May) by attending two summer sessions. These two summer sessions taken together will qualify for one semester of residency if the following requirements are met: The student must enroll in two summer sessions and enroll in a minimum of six credit hours during each summer session. The student must satisfactorily complete at least 12 credit hours in the two sessions. Credit hours earned during Maymester may count toward the residency requirement. However, to receive residency credit, a student must complete at least one course during each of the two seven-week summer sessions. Credit for Summer School Courses Taken at Other Law Schools. With the approval of the Associate Dean for Academic Affairs, students may receive credit for courses taken at another ABA/AALS-approved law school or taken at a summer program sponsored by an ABA/AALS-approved law school. Such approval is contingent upon satisfactory completion of the approved courses. The student must take the course for a letter grade if the course is offered on this basis. Grades of C or better will be recorded on the student's transcript as earned credit, and any grade below a C will be not be included. “Incomplete” (or its equivalent) will be recorded as an F if the work is not completed within three months of the end of classes for the session involved.

Students must earn a ""C"" or better for a class to count towards a minor or cognate. Note that pre-med, pre-law and pre-pharmacy cannot be minors. They can qualify as cognates but classes must be taken at the appropriate level. Notes on Cognates Please note to your students who choose the cognate option that most areas of study require them to take courses at the 300-level. For example, if a student wants to pursue an ""education cognate,"" all their courses should start at the 300-level and higher. There are exceptions to this rule such as philosophy cognates which can begin at the 200-level. The exceptions can be found in the student handbook. Minor Bulletin Encourage your students to choose a minor as soon as possible. Some minors require classes which are only offered in certain semesters or require prerequisites. The current minor bulletin can be found on the Undergraduate Bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/) . Senior Checks Students are advised to get a senior check done for them the semester before the semester they plan to graduate (so if they are graduating in May of any given year, they should do their senior check in the previous fall semester). This way, the undergraduate office in combination with the Dean\'s office can catch any errors in the student\'s file or warn them of classes they need to finish in order to graduate.
