Foundational courses are taken early in the undergraduate experience and apply across disciplines. Integrative courses are taken near the end of study and apply to discipline-specific majors. Colleges and programs will also have specific requirements in each major and in some cases will have a list of recommended Carolina Core courses. Faculty members teaching a foundational Carolina Core course will need to adopt the relevant Carolina Core learning outcomes particular to that class. All Carolina Core courses must cover the learning outcomes identified in the template syllabi of approved Core courses. Instructors may add additional course content, but the essential outcomes must be covered. An interactive list of Faculty Senate-approved courses meeting the Carolina Core requirements is available online. Prototypical syllabi are available for all Carolina Core courses. They include student achievements and illustrate options for tailoring the syllabi for individual classes. Select a course from the approved list to view the syllabus or see the Carolina Core Syllabus Requirements for Teaching [pdf] . Advising Students on the Core The Carolina Core curriculum covers students who entered USC-Columbia, Lancaster, Salkehatchie, Sumter, or Union, for the first time in Fall 2012 or later. Students earn a degree under curricular requirements in force when they first enroll in a baccalaureate program at any campus of the University of South Carolina.

2,Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,"['Is this one of those?) Course Proposals Requiring Syllabi New courses (including new cross-lists) and courses that involves a significant change in course description, a change in Carolina Core or GLD designation, or a change in delivery mode to >50% online require a file syllabus. The following checklist items apply. Designator, Title, Course Info Does the course title in the proposal match that in the syllabus? Does the syllabus indicate the instructors\' name as well as course meting days, times, and location (or equivalent)? Does the bulletin description in the proposal match that in the syllabus? Pre- or Co-requisites Are the pre/co-requisites included in the syllabus and do they match those in/proposed for the bulletin? Special Topics and Independent Studies These course are often variable credit and can be taken multiple times. The proposal should include the range of hours, number of times the course can be taken for credit and the maximum number of credit hours that can be applied to the degree. The Number of times the course can be taken for credit is not how many attempts a student can have to pass the course, but is how many times it can be taken, usually under different topics or studies. Example: Credit hours minimum for a single offering is 1. Credit hours maximum for a single offering is 6. Number of times the course can be taken is 6. Number of credit hours if course can be taken multiple times is 12. Is this all correct in the proposal? Learning Outcomes Does the syllabus include ""Learning Outcomes"" and use that exact phrase (as opposed to ""Learning Objectives"" etc.)? Do the Learning Outcome describe significant and essential learning that students will achieve and can reliably demonstrate at the end of a course, e.g., ""By the end of the course, students will: ....""? Do the statements follow best-practices, particularly with respect to action verbs that identify quantifiable or measurable actions? See https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/coursedevelopment/learning_outcomes/(https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/course_design_development_delivery/learning_outcomes/index.php) and www.apu.edu/live_data/files/333/blooms_taxonomy_action_verbs.pdf(http://www.apu.edu/live_data/files/333/blooms_taxonomy_action_verbs.pdf) If this is a 500/600 level course is there at least one learning outcome specific to graduate students? This should connect to an assignment specific to graduate students.', 'Any substitutions for degree requirements recommended in the student’s academic advisory plan must be referred to the Scholastic Standards and Petitions Committee of the student’s college for action. Changes in Curriculum Undergraduate students interested in changing majors should contact the college or school offering the new curriculum the student intends to follow. Once all necessary permissions are obtained, the college or school that offers the new curriculum will notify the Office of the University Registrar to update the student’s record. Curriculum changes can affect loan deferment, scholarship eligibility, athletic participation eligibility, tuition and fee assessment, and international student VISA regulations. For this reason, all curriculum changes must be completed before the end of the free drop/add period in Fall and Spring Terms (in Part of Term 30), and prior to June 1 during the Summer Term. Curriculum change requests that arrive at the Office of the University Registrar after these deadlines will be processed for the following term. Exceptions to this rule may be made in the event that a change request is being made in the semester that student is graduating from the University. Course Substitutions Only under unavoidable and exceptional circumstances will the faculty permit substitution for or exemption from the prescribed curricula. When it becomes necessary to request a deviation from the prescribed course of study, students should consult the dean of their college or the head of the department in which they are majoring before preparing a petition listing the substitutions or exemptions sought and the reasons for the request. Petitions are submitted on forms obtainable from the Scholastic Standards and Petitions Committee of the particular college, and must be returned to the dean of the college in which the student is enrolled. Deviations from degree requirements published in the bulletin must be approved by the student’s dean and the head of the student’s major department. The Scholastic Standards and Petitions Committee of each college functions as an appeal board in cases where agreement between the dean, department head, and the student cannot be reached. Course and Academic Credit Policies Course Numbering Courses numbered from 101 to 699 are available at different levels for undergraduate credit. Courses numbered from 700 to 899 may be taken for graduate credit only and are described in the Graduate Studies Bulletin . All courses numbered from 101 to 499 are for four-year baccalaureate degree candidates. Courses numbered from 500 to 699 may be taken by advanced undergraduate and graduate students for undergraduate or graduate credit, respectively. A 500- to 600-level course taken for undergraduate credit cannot later be awarded graduate credit. Course Credit The credit value of each course is usually determined by the amount of formal instructional time per week for one semester. At least 700 minutes of instruction (and at least twice that for laboratory time) can be expected per credit hour. The semester hour credit for each course is included in each course description. No student suspended from the University of South Carolina for any reason may earn academic credit during the period of suspension, whether by residence elsewhere or by correspondence courses of any origin. Remedial courses (courses numbered 100 or below) may not be used to meet degree requirements. Credit by Examination Currently enrolled students may obtain credit by examination in a course in which they have had no class attendance or semester standing; permission must, however, be obtained from the dean of the college or department chair in which the course is offered. A grade of not less than B on the examination is necessary in order to receive credit for the course. Examinations are not permitted in courses in which a student previously has been enrolled regularly or as an auditor. The applicant must pay to the Office of Financial Services in advance of the examination a fee of $25 per semester hour; this fee is not refundable. The Office of Financial Services will issue a receipt which must be shown to the head of the department conducting the examination, who shall immediately report the results of the examination to the Office of the University Registrar.']","Yes, when making changes to a cross-listed course, it affects all cross-listed courses associated with it. This includes updates to course descriptions, prerequisites, learning outcomes, and other aspects of the course syllabus. It's crucial to ensure that all cross-listed courses remain consistent and up-to-date to avoid confusion for students. Therefore, when proposing changes to a cross-listed course, keep in mind that these modifications will impact all related courses within the cross-listing.",Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Getting approval for distributed learning for one cross-listed course does not automatically approve cross listed courses for distributed learning delivery.

3,Do prerequisites have to be enforced in Banner?,"['Make sure that you satisfy all the prereqs of the classes that you plan to take. If you don\'t then Banner will not allow you to sign up for the class. If you believe you don\'t need the prereqs, discuss it with your advisor. If he or she agrees then you can fill out a Request for Prereq Waiver . If that request is approved then you will be allowed to sign up for the class. If a class is full by the time you try to sign up for it, fill out our Override Request form (aka ""the wait list"") and we will try to increase the class size so you can sign up. You can do the same thing for courses in other departments. Namely, you can submit math class(http://www.math.sc.edu/) override requests, physics class(http://www.physics.sc.edu/) override requests (look for ""Override Request"" in their websites). If you have any questions or problems, please contact our Undergraduate Director Dr.']","Yes, prerequisites generally must be enforced in Banner when signing up for classes at the University of South Carolina. This means that if you want to register for a specific course, you typically need to have completed the required prerequisites first. The purpose of this system is to ensure that students have the necessary background knowledge and skills to succeed in more advanced courses.

However, there may be some situations where prerequisites can be waived. For instance, if you believe you have the appropriate knowledge or experience despite not meeting the prerequisites, you can discuss this with your academic advisor. If your advisor agrees, you can fill out a Request for Prerequisite Waiver form. If this request is approved, you will be allowed to sign up for the class even without fulfilling the prerequisites.

In case a class is full by the time you attempt to sign up for it, you can submit an Override Request (also known as the waitlist) form. The department will then try to increase the class size so that you can enroll in it. Keep in mind that similar procedures apply to overriding prerequisites for classes in other departments, such as math or physics.","Prerequisites do not have to be enforced in Banner. However,it is recommended that they be enforced,as they are published in the Bulletin. It creates inconsistency in University sources to list prerequisites on the Bulletin,but then not enforce them in Banner.",0.9999999999,0.0

5,How do I change my program learning outcomes?,"['Learning outcomes should neither be easy nor impossible to attain, but somewhere in between. Time-Framed: A learning outcome should include a specific date by which it will be completed. It is important to allow enough time to successfully implement the steps needed to achieve the objective, but not so much as to elicit procrastination. Carolina Core courses are required to have uniformed learning outcomes. You should not modify Carolina Core learning outcomes – even if they are not measurable or clear. If the learning outcomes for your Carolina Core course are not measurable, be sure to create measurable and clear module learning objectives.

Similar to course learning outcomes, module learning objectives describe the measurable skills, abilities, knowledge, or values that students should be able to do or demonstrate as a result of completing a module. The objectives should align with course learning outcomes. Module learning objectives describe specific skills students should learn within the module.

Instructional materials, assessments, activities, and activities should align with and be consistent with the course learning outcomes and the module learning objectives. Instructional materials include content within a course. Instructional materials may include, but are not limited to, textbook readings, articles, videos, podcasts, Open Educational Resources (OERs), publisher resources, and lecture notes. Assessments determine how well students are learning course content and meeting the goals of the course. It should be clear that assessments measure the achievement of learning outcomes/objectives. Assessments may include, but are not limited to, annotated bibliographies, blogs, critical reviews, digital storytelling, ePortfolios, essays, exams, field work, journals, online labs, literature reviews, peer reviews, presentations, projects, quizzes, reports, role play, self-assessments, and wikis. Consider including a variety of formative assessments to gauge student progress throughout the course. Learning activities facilitate students’ achievement of course learning outcomes and module learning objectives. Course activities should be suited to the level of the course. Learning activities may include, but are not limited to, case studies, class discussions, concept maps, simulations, student presentations, creating outlines, debates, free writing, interviewing, journaling, musical composition, service learning, practicing a speech, simulations, solving a problem, virtual field trips, virtual labs, and writing reflections.

Introduction Learning outcomes are not standalone statements. They must all relate to each other and to the title of the unit and avoid repetition. Articulating learning outcomes for students is part of good teaching. If you tell students what you expect them to do, and give them practice in doing it, then there is a good chance that they will be able to do it on a test or major assignment. That is to say, they will have learned what you wanted them to know. If you do not tell them what they will be expected to do, then they are left guessing what you want. If they guess wrong, they will resent you for being tricky, obscure or punishing. Why Learning Outcomes? Learning outcomes help faculty to: Decide our emphasis in the course: Of all the things we could teach, what should we teach? Decide how best to teach: Teaching students to analyze requires different teaching approaches from teaching students to memorize. Decide how best to assess learning: Do I need a project or a final exam? Communicate expectations to students: What are our decisions on the matters above? Learning outcomes help students by: Creating a connection between teaching and learning, between professors and students Taking much of the guessing out of the student's attempt to learn Enabling them to truly master the content of the course Learning outcomes need to be SMART . Specific : The learning outcome should be well defined and clear. It states exactly what will be accomplished. Measurable : The learning outcome should provide a benchmark or target so that the institution can determine when the target has been reached, by how much it has been exceeded or by how much it has fallen short. Agreed Upon : Important stakeholders must be in general agreement with the institution’s mission, goals and learning outcomes. Stakeholders may include university, school administration, faculty, students, alumni and/or community members. Realistic : Learning outcomes should be reasonable given the available resources. Learning outcomes should neither be easy nor impossible to attain, but somewhere in between. Time-Framed : A learning outcome should include a specific date by which it will be completed.

Click on the Expand All + sign to view the elements of a Learning Outcome Statement Expand all Format of the Learning Outcome Statement Bloom’s Revised Taxonomy provides the framework for writing course-level learning outcomes. Each learning outcome is represented by a sentence that consists of an action verb related to a cognitive process and a clearly defined content related to a specific knowledge type. All learning outcomes have a common format: Subject Verb Object S V O The SUBJECT of the Learning Outcome Statement The SUBJECT of the learning outcome statement is the student or the learner. Examples : Each student will be able to use word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and presentation graphics in preparing their final research project and report. Upon completion of the module on educational objectives, students will be able to classify specific educational objectives into the cognitive (knowing), psychomotor (doing) and affective (feeling) learning domains. The VERB of the Learning Outcome Statement Each verb in a learning outcome statement represents a cognitive process. Learning outcomes should consider the different types of cognitive processes involved in knowledge retention and transfer. Cognitive Process Description Remember Retrieve relevant knowledge from long-term memory Understand Construct meaning from oral, written, and graphic communication Apply Carry out or use a procedure in a given situation Analyze Break material into its constituent parts and determine how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose Evaluate Make judgments based on criteria and standards Create Put elements together to form a structure or reorganize elements into a new structure The Cognitive Process Dimension s shows action verbs in increasing order of complexity that are directly related to cognitive processes. Please note that verbs such as list, state, and write cannot be used as verbs in learning outcome statements because they do not have anything to do with cognitive processes. The OBJECT of the Learning Outcome Statement. The object of the learning outcome statement is derived most often from the course content. The course content can be linked to four general types of knowledge: Factual, Conceptual, Procedural, and Metacognitive. The table below explains these types of knowledge along with their specific subtypes and provides examples for each one.

Revisions may include changes to the bulletin, delivery method, or other edits to be approved through faculty governance. Course Development Course development consists of creation and revision of curricula. The faculty of the University has legislative authority over matters pertaining to the curriculum on the campus where they serve. Faculty governance committees on each campus review all requests to create, revise, or eliminate graduate and undergraduate courses to ensure all offerings meet the academic expectation of the University. See ACAF 2.03 Creation and Revision of Academic Courses [pdf](http://sc.edu/policies/acaf203.pdf) Expand all New Course Propose a new course New courses require approval by the Unit Head, College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council.

Carolina Core Courses Designating a foundational course as Carolina Core Designating a course as Carolina Core requires approval by the Carolina Core Committee. For a new course submitted in APPS, complete the Carolina Core information. If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, a course change proposal must be submitted in APPS with the Carolina Core information completed. Integrative Course Proposals An Integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. As a result, regulatory oversight is ceded predominantly to the academic unit. A department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporates one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes such that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course. The following is the process to designate or delete an Integrative course. Add an Integrative Course Submit a new course proposal or course change proposal as appropriate in APPS. In the justification section, provide the following information: Carolina Core Integrative Course, Major Name, Degree (e.g., ANTH 444, Anthropology, B.S.) and explain which Carolina Core Learning outcomes(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/faculty-and-staff/learning-outcomes.php) are met by the course and how the course meets the Carolina Core Learning outcome(s). No syllabus is required.

What is Navigate? EAB Navigate is one of the four advising technologies used on the USC Columbia campus. It is heavily utilized as the primary scheduling platform for academic advising appointments, as well as for nearly two dozen student service offices around campus. The original platform is intended to guide the prioritization of outreach to and interaction with students based on risk levels and success marker flags. The success markers are established by each department based on the courses that are most predictive of success in each major over time using USC historic student data, or based on critical courses from major maps. These involve both threshold grades in key courses and the timing of those courses. Risk levels are based on student performance and characteristics relative to other students who have graduated in the particular major. Success markers, risk levels, and student characteristics (GPA ranges, class level, department, college, native/transfer, etc.) can be used to quickly query lists of students who may need further assistance. EAB Navigate for Scheduling - Academic Units The list below includes all colleges, departments, and advising units currently utilizing EAB Navigate for scheduling their appointments with students.

See ACAF 2.03 Creation and Revision of Academic Courses [pdf](http://sc.edu/policies/acaf203.pdf) Expand all New Course Propose a new course New courses require approval by the Unit Head, College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Proposals for new courses are submitted in APPS. The C & C committee, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council may request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns. Change a Course Propose a change to a course Changes to an existing course require approval by the Unit Head, Office of Distributed Learning (if adding DL delivery), College/School Representative, Carolina Core Committee (if change is to or adding a Carolina Core course) and Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Changes may include hours, bulletin description, pre-requisites, etc. Proposals for course changes are submitted in APPS. The C & C committee, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council may request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns. Terminate a Course Propose a course termination Course terminations require approval at Department, College Representative, Curricula and Courses/Faculty Senate or Graduate Council. Proposals for course termination are submitted in APPS. The C & C committee, Faculty Senate or Graduate Council may request program representation at meetings to address questions or concerns. Carolina Core Courses Designating a foundational course as Carolina Core Designating a course as Carolina Core requires approval by the Carolina Core Committee. For a new course submitted in APPS, complete the Carolina Core information. If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, a course change proposal must be submitted in APPS with the Carolina Core information completed. Integrative Course Proposals An Integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. As a result, regulatory oversight is ceded predominantly to the academic unit. A department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporates one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes such that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course. The following is the process to designate or delete an Integrative course. Add an Integrative Course Submit a new course proposal or course change proposal as appropriate in APPS. In the justification section, provide the following information: Carolina Core Integrative Course, Major Name, Degree (e.g., ANTH 444, Anthropology, B.S.) and explain which Carolina Core Learning outcomes(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/faculty-and-staff/learning-outcomes.php) are met by the course and how the course meets the Carolina Core Learning outcome(s). No syllabus is required. Delete an Integrative Course For deletions of only the Integrative Course designation (not the whole course), submit a course change proposal in APPS and state in the justification that the Integrative Course designation is being deleted. Upon Approval in Faculty Senate, the Integrative Course will be scribed into Degree Works.']","At the University of South Carolina, course actions involve creating new courses, revising or editing existing ones, or eliminating them entirely.

If the proposal indicates that it will require more than one account to be set up, but there is only one budget attached to the proposal, should I return the proposal to the PI? Yes, return the proposal and ask the PI to submit a separate budget for each intended account. There should be a separate account for every separate unit (i.e., department/school or college) represented in the project’s budget. Separate budgets simplify tracking and collection of indirect costs when awards are made and projects are established.

However, if your proposal involves multiple accounts or units from different departments or schools within the University of South Carolina, it is recommended to create separate budgets for each account. This simplifies tracking and collection of indirect costs when awards are made and projects are established.

In general, it's essential to consult with your departmental administrator or research office early in the proposal development process to ensure compliance with all relevant regulations and internal procedures. They can help determine whether external approvals are necessary for your specific situation. Remember, being proactive and well-informed about these matters can save time and effort during the submission and review stages.","Only programs require external approvals (the President,Board of Trustees (BoT),SACS,and CHE notification or approval),as outline in ACAF 2.00: ""All new academic programs and program name changes across the entire USC system must be approved by the president.

Lauren Brown of the Student Success Center has helped us put together a list of tips to guide you through the most stressful time of the year. Come up with a study plan Before hitting the books, you need to know what to expect for the exam. When and where are your exams? Are your exams cumulative or do they cover the last few weeks? What is the format of your exam? Knowing this information can help you determine how you need to study for each exam and when you need to start studying for each exam. It’s recommended that students spread their studying out seven days before their exam. Brown also advises that students break their studying up into “chunks” within that week. For each chunk, determine what you want to cover, what your study strategy will be and the amount of time you’ll need. Once you get to the day before the exam, you should do a general review of the material with a focus on your weakest areas. Lastly, study smarter, not harder. Once you get back from Thanksgiving break, you should start to implement your study plan. Use campus resources Another way to study effectively for finals is to make use of campus resources. The Student Success Center can be your go-to for all of your finals needs. In partnership with Russell House, the center will be hosting over 50 two-hour finals review sessions starting Dec. 4 and running through the remainder of finals week. Students can also drop into Russell House for tutoring between Dec. 1 and 4, and schedule one-on-one appointments on the Mezzanine level of the Thomas Cooper Library beginning Dec. 6.', 'More info on these resources can be found on the student success center website . Remember to take care of yourself Although finals week is a very important time of the semester, it’s also important to take care of yourself and prioritize your mental health. Remember to take periodic breaks throughout your study time as it allows your mind to reset. It is also important to remember to get a good night’s sleep, giving your brain the rest it needs to ace your finals.']","To find out when your finals are, I recommend checking your course syllabi first, as your professors should have provided specific dates and times for each final examination. If you cannot locate this information in your syllabi, consider reaching out to your professors directly or consulting your academic advisor for assistance. Additionally, the University of South Carolina's Student Success Center often provides resources and support during finals week, including review sessions and tutoring, so keep an eye on their website for further information and guidance.",Check the final exam schedule.,0.0,0.0

Qualified students can take courses that count toward both undergraduate and graduate degrees, reducing the time and cost to earn the graduate degree. How does it work? Qualified undergraduate students can earn up to 12 credit hours of graduate-level classes while still an undergraduate through the Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan. Here's how it works: Classes must be 500-level and above Classes must be taken for graduate credit through the application process described below Classes can be applied to your baccalaureate program and, with graduate program admission and approval, applied to your graduate program of study The use of dual credit can reduce the total time to earn both the undergraduate and graduate degrees. You can also use your undergraduate financial aid to pay for the dual credit courses. What graduate programs are available? While our five-year bachelor’s/master’s programs of study are popular, all of our graduate certificates, master’s degrees and Ph.D. programs are eligible for inclusion in an Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan. For specifics on our offerings, visit our Graduate Programs page. Who is eligible? You will need to have earned at least 90 hours of undergraduate coursework and have a minimum GPA of 3.4 to formally apply for this program. However, we encourage engineering and computing students to start planning, with your advisor’s help, before your junior year. Note that you don’t need to be pursuing an undergraduate degree from the Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing to start in one of our accelerated graduate programs. Of course, classes taken for dual credit must be degree-applicable for both your undergraduate degree and your intended graduate program of study. When both are in the same or similar discipline, it is easy to earn up to 12 hours of dual credit. We want you to be able to earn as much dual credit as possible, so please discuss the Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan with your advisor prior to taking your engineering, computing and technical electives and other 500-level classes that may be available for dual credit. You need to initially register for such classes for graduate credit for them to count, as graduate credit cannot be awarded retroactively. How do I apply? You will need to submit an initial application before registering for your first class in this program, and then again prior to each semester that you want to earn dual credit for a class.

Any qualified student, regardless of major or career interest, can take advantage of the College’s rich educational environment. Retention in the College To remain in good standing in the College, Honors College students must maintain a minimum GPA on a sliding scale that starts at 3.00 for first-year students and rises to 3.30 for seniors. In addition, Honors College students must earn Honors course credits - 9 by the end of their first year, 18 after their sophomore year, and 27 after their junior year-to remain in good standing in the college. Students who fall short of these requirements are allowed one semester of probation to increase their GPA or the number of honors credits to reach the required level. Any student who wants to apply for grade forgiveness for a South Carolina Honors College course must first petition the dean of the Honors College. Honors College Advising Entering Honors College first-year students are advised by the staff of Honors College prior to and during Freshmen Orientation, and the College continues to advise all Honors College students throughout their time in the College. Once a student has selected a major, he or she also is advised by faculty and/or staff members in that discipline. For this reason, most Honors College students have two advisors. Graduation with Honors from the South Carolina Honors College Honors College students have the opportunity to “graduate with Honors from the South Carolina Honors College.” This accomplishment is recognized on their transcript, their diploma, and during commencement. In order to graduate with honors, students must complete at least 45 credit hours of Honors College courses, including a minimum 3 credit hours of senior thesis or project. The course requirements must include one course each in English, laboratory science, the history of civilization, analytical reasoning, the humanities, the social sciences, and an outside the classroom experience (Beyond the Classroom) that could be either undergraduate research, an Honors service learning course, study away, or an internship. Honors College elective credits may be in any area. All Honors College students, regardless of their major, can complete these requirements. SCHC Curriculum The Honors College offers two types of courses: courses that are unique to the Honors College and Honors College versions of courses offered by other academic units. Honors College sections of courses offered by other academic units carry the same departmental designator and number as their non-honors equivalent, but they have a “Hxx” section number (e.g., ENGL 101 , Section H01). Courses developed specifically for the Honors College are designated “SCHC.” While SCHC courses have no exact equivalent in the non-honors curriculum, every effort is made to ensure that these courses fulfill university core, major, minor, or cognate requirements. SCHC courses that are numbered 200 or higher, “proseminars,” are designed to be similar in style to graduate-level seminars and are taught, where possible, through the use of discussion rather than lecture. Normally no more than 18 students may enroll in an Honors College proseminar. At the 200-level, proseminars are usually broad in scope, providing a firm grounding in the general area described by a discipline. At the junior (300) and senior (400) levels, proseminars are more specific in content, providing the students and the professor the opportunity to delve deeply into a specialized subject. Of special interest are the interdisciplinary proseminars, which are designed to bring knowledge from several academic disciplines to bear on a particular problem. Proseminars may be taught by more than one faculty member. South Carolina Honors College students may meet University Core Curriculum requirements through Honors courses determined to be core-appropriate by the South Carolina Honors College, with the oversight of the Provost. The South Carolina Honors College maintains a list of such courses.

No prior arrangement is needed for guests who need assisted seating. Additional details can be found on our Tickets and Seating page .', 'The purpose of these discussions is to determine whether requested or proposed accommodations can be provided to allow you to perform the essential functions of your position without creating an undue hardship on your department/division or the university. Is my employer required to implement my first preference for an accommodation? Not necessarily. Employers must offer effective accommodations, which may or may not be the employee’s first choice or preference for an accommodation. The appropriateness of an accommodation must be analyzed in its specific context through an interactive process between the employer and the employee. If you have questions or concerns regarding an accommodation that has or has not been provided to you, please contact the Employee Relations Office by emailing uscer@mailbox.sc.edu or calling 803-777-3821. What are the nondiscrimination requirements of the ADA, as amended? The ADA prohibits discrimination in all employment practices, including job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. It applies to recruitment, advertising, tenure, layoff, leave, fringe benefits, and all other employment-related activities. If you have questions or concerns regarding an accommodation that has or has not been provided to you, please contact the Employee Relations Office by emailing uscer@mailbox.sc.edu or calling 803-777-3821. If you feel that you have been subjected to unlawful discrimination or harassment related to a disability, please contact the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (by calling 803-777-3854 or emailing eop@mailbox.sc.edu . You may also file a complaint online(https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofSouthCarolinaEOP&layout_id=40.) . Who is protected against employment discrimination by the ADA, as amended? Employment discrimination is prohibited against ""qualified individuals with disabilities."" Persons discriminated against because they have a known association or relationship with a disabled individual are also protected. The ADA defines an ""individual with a disability"" as a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities or bodily functions, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. The first part of the definition makes clear that the ADA applies to persons who have substantial, as distinct from minor impairments, and that these must be impairments that limit major life activities or bodily functions. Major life activities include seeing, hearing, speaking, walking, breathing, performing manual tasks, learning, caring for oneself, and working. Major bodily functions include, functions of the immune system, normal cell growth, digestive, bowel, bladder, neurological, brain, respiratory, circulatory, endocrine, and reproductive functions. An individual with epilepsy, paralysis, a substantial hearing or visual impairment, mental retardation, or a learning disability would be covered, but an individual with a minor, non-chronic condition of short duration, such as a sprain, infection, or broken limb, generally would not be covered. The second part of the definition allows for protections, for example, for a person with a history of cancer that is currently in remission or a person with a history of mental illness. The third part of the definition protects individuals who are regarded and treated as though they have a substantially limiting disability, even though they may not have such an impairment. For example, this provision would protect a severely disfigured qualified individual from being denied employment because an employer feared the ""negative reactions"" of others. Who is a ""qualified individual with a disability?"" A qualified individual with a disability is a person who meets legitimate skill, experience, education, or other requirements of an employment position that he or she holds or seeks, and who can perform the ""essential functions"" of the position with or without reasonable accommodations. Requiring the ability to perform ""essential"" functions assures that an individual will not be considered unqualified simply because of an inability to perform marginal or incidental job functions. If the individual is qualified to perform essential job functions except for limitations caused by a disability, the employer must consider whether the individual could perform these functions with a reasonable accommodation. What is ""reasonable accommodation?"" A reasonable accommodation is a modification or an adjustment to a job or the work environment that will enable a qualified applicant or employee with a disability to participate in the application process or to perform essential job functions. Reasonable accommodation also includes adjustments to assure that a qualified individual with a disability has rights and privileges in employment equal to those of non-disabled employees. What kinds of actions are required to reasonably accommodate applicants and employees? Examples of reasonable accommodations include: Making existing facilities used by employees readily accessible to and usable by an individual with a disability; Restructuring a job; Modifying work schedules; Acquiring or modifying equipment; Appropriately modifying documents, training, or other programs, etc. Employers are not required to lower quality or quantity standards in order to make an accommodation, nor are they obligated to provide personal use items such as glasses or hearing aids. The decision as to the appropriate accommodation for a specific individual must be based on the facts of each case. In selecting the reasonable accommodation to be provided, the principal test is that of effectiveness, i.e., whether the accommodation will enable the person with a disability to do the job in question. Must employers be familiar with the many diverse types of disabilities to know whether or how to make a reasonable accommodation? No. An employer is required to accommodate only a ""known"" disability of a qualified applicant or employee. The requirement generally will be triggered by a request from an individual with a disability, who frequently can suggest an appropriate accommodation. Accommodations must be made on an individual basis because the nature and extent of a disabling condition and the requirements of the job will vary in each case. If the individual does not request an accommodation, the employer is not obligated to provide one. If a disabled person requests, but cannot suggest, an appropriate accommodation, the employer and the individual should work together through an interactive process to identify one. There are also many public and private resources that can provide assistance without cost.', 'As an Equal Opportunity Employer, we will provide reasonable accommodations to qualified persons with disabilities.

52,How do I know if I will graduate with honors?,"['It emphasizes small classes with intensive interaction between students and professors. The Honors College curriculum is designed to exploit fully the talents of both students and teachers. Any qualified student, regardless of major or career interest, can take advantage of the College’s rich educational environment. Retention in the College To remain in good standing in the College, Honors College students must maintain a minimum GPA on a sliding scale that starts at 3.00 for first-year students and rises to 3.30 for seniors. In addition, Honors College students must earn Honors course credits - 9 by the end of their first year, 18 after their sophomore year, and 27 after their junior year-to remain in good standing in the college. Students who fall short of these requirements are allowed one semester of probation to increase their GPA or the number of honors credits to reach the required level. Any student who wants to apply for grade forgiveness for a South Carolina Honors College course must first petition the dean of the Honors College. Honors College Advising Entering Honors College first-year students are advised by the staff of Honors College prior to and during Freshmen Orientation, and the College continues to advise all Honors College students throughout their time in the College. Once a student has selected a major, he or she also is advised by faculty and/or staff members in that discipline. For this reason, most Honors College students have two advisors. Graduation with Honors from the South Carolina Honors College Honors College students have the opportunity to “graduate with Honors from the South Carolina Honors College.” This accomplishment is recognized on their transcript, their diploma, and during commencement. In order to graduate with honors, students must complete at least 45 credit hours of Honors College courses, including a minimum 3 credit hours of senior thesis or project. The course requirements must include one course each in English, laboratory science, the history of civilization, analytical reasoning, the humanities, the social sciences, and an outside the classroom experience (Beyond the Classroom) that could be either undergraduate research, an Honors service learning course, study away, or an internship. Honors College elective credits may be in any area. All Honors College students, regardless of their major, can complete these requirements. SCHC Curriculum The Honors College offers two types of courses: courses that are unique to the Honors College and Honors College versions of courses offered by other academic units. Honors College sections of courses offered by other academic units carry the same departmental designator and number as their non-honors equivalent, but they have a “Hxx” section number (e.g., ENGL 101 , Section H01). Courses developed specifically for the Honors College are designated “SCHC.” While SCHC courses have no exact equivalent in the non-honors curriculum, every effort is made to ensure that these courses fulfill university core, major, minor, or cognate requirements. SCHC courses that are numbered 200 or higher, “proseminars,” are designed to be similar in style to graduate-level seminars and are taught, where possible, through the use of discussion rather than lecture. Normally no more than 18 students may enroll in an Honors College proseminar. At the 200-level, proseminars are usually broad in scope, providing a firm grounding in the general area described by a discipline. At the junior (300) and senior (400) levels, proseminars are more specific in content, providing the students and the professor the opportunity to delve deeply into a specialized subject. Of special interest are the interdisciplinary proseminars, which are designed to bring knowledge from several academic disciplines to bear on a particular problem. Proseminars may be taught by more than one faculty member. South Carolina Honors College students may meet University Core Curriculum requirements through Honors courses determined to be core-appropriate by the South Carolina Honors College, with the oversight of the Provost. The South Carolina Honors College maintains a list of such courses.

Students who earn Graduation with Leadership Distinction demonstrate extensive, purposeful engagement beyond the classroom, understanding of course concepts in “real world” settings, and application of learning to make decisions and solve problems. Recognition This formal distinction honors the broader scope of achievements for students engaged within and beyond the classroom and sets them apart in ways worthy of recognition by others (e.g., potential employers, graduate schools). Students are recognized with graduation cords and the distinction appears on graduates’ transcripts and diplomas as “With Leadership Distinction in (Pathway Name)” or “With Leadership Distinction” on the diploma if multiple pathways are completed (with the complete list of pathways appearing on the transcript). Eligibility Students can earn Graduation with Leadership Distinction if they meet the requirements , have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or greater, and graduate with an associate or baccalaureate degree in any major from USC Columbia, Lancaster, Salkehatchie, Sumter or Union.

Charleston Mayor Joe Riley, who is retiring this year after leading the city since 1975, will deliver the commencement address. As students walk across the stage Monday for the final commencement of 2015, the university completes a record year for the number of students earning Graduation with Leadership Distinction on their diplomas. Nearly 40 students at the December commencement will receive the GLD honor, bringing the total of 2015 graduates to 248. These students engage in beyond-the-classroom learning, document their activities and reflect on their overall college experiences in an e-portfolio. The honor is posted on transcripts and diplomas, which can help as they apply to graduate schools or enter the job market. In 2014, there were 105 graduates with leadership distinction. Irma Van Scoy , director of USC Connect, says most students initially pursue the GLD because they want the recognition on their transcript and diploma. ""That\'s what gets them interested, but by the time they finish the process, they can really articulate the significance of their undergraduate education — what they have learned in class and out of class,"" Van Scoy says. ""They end up saying, \'This is one of the most valuable things I\'ve done at USC and now I know where I\'m going.\' "" More than 850 Carolina students are now pursuing the GLD recognition, with more than 300 expected to graduate in May 2016. Students in every college and school at the university, along with students from the four Palmetto College campuses, are represented in the program. Van Scoy says the GLD program has helped people understand integrated learning and offers students a chance to take related coursework, demonstrate what they\'ve learned through a presentation, reflect on their undergraduate experience and consider how they will apply learning to lead in the future. Students can choose one of four GLD paths: community service, global learning, professional and civic engagement or research. One of the students graduating Monday is Max D. Emory of Lancaster, S.C., who will earn his degree in mechanical engineering with leadership distinction in professional and civic engagement. He has accepted a position at Savannah River Nuclear Solutions\' Engineering Leadership Development Program. ""Outside of GLD allowing me to learn a lot about myself, it has really boosted my confidence and solidified my thoughts about who I am and what I am passionate about. GLD was not easy to obtain by any means and challenged me in different ways. With the help of my adviser, Lisa Camp, I really enjoyed my experience,"" Emory says. ""We, as college students, are involved in so many different things throughout our journey we don\'t take the time to look back at what we\'ve accomplished and learned. GLD gave me the opportunity to do just that. I learned a lot about my own experiences, that I thought were insignificant at the time but that really changed the way I think about things today. ""GLD has made me more excited for my future. Not that I wasn\'t excited before, but seeing other people excited about my passion and where I am headed has really energized me and reassured me that I am on the right track."" Grace Gardner of Cincinnati will graduate with a major of international studies and women\'s and gender studies and a minor in leadership studies. She plans to move home to Ohio, where she will explore a career in medicine, possibly in an accelerated nursing degree program. She also has applied to the Peace Corps. She chose to pursue GLD after she applied to be an Emerging Leaders Program mentor in the fall of her junior year. The interviewer pointed out that Gardner already had many of the pieces for the GLD. ""I\'m so glad I chose this track at USC because it gave meaning to all the positions I held in my time here. While I loved each experience as I was a part of them, taking the time to reflect on them and connect each leadership role to my learning in the classroom was really powerful,"" Gardner says. ""All the seemingly unconnected positions I held and internships I had mean so much more to me and have given me skills I will carry with me forever. I can definitely market my experience to future employers, too. ""It taught me to identify things you\'re passionate about and to pursue them, no matter what.

58,Where do I find textbook information for my online course?,"[""There's no one answer for everyone, but you can use a mix of Open Educational Resources, library-licensed resources, and items freely available or in the public domain on the web. Don't get discouraged if you do not immediately see an open textbook that fits your needs. A librarian can help you locate alternate resources to make your class affordable. Using OER Using Open Educational Resources (OER) is one way to make your class affordable. Most OER are funded by governments, foundation grants, or universities and are created, edited, and peer-reviewed by academics, ensuring that their quality is comparable to traditional textbooks. While many OER are created for lower level, high-enrollment courses, more are being developed for higher-level specialized courses. To locate OER to use in your classes, visit http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/opentextbooks(http://guides.library.sc.edu/OER/opentextbooks) . Using Library-Licensed Resources While library-licensed resources are not OER and may come with copyright and licensing restrictions, using materials available through your library can save your students money. The library offers e-books, databases, and journals that can be easily linked to and freely accessed through Blackboard or your syllabus. Course Materials Support The library will scan library materials or find links to resources for you at no cost in Blackboard. We will also address copyright concerns connected to posting these materials. To provide this service, we need a list of the reading assignments as well as the dates of the assignments.

Admissions University Admissions, part of Enrollment Management, provides centralized services for prospective and current applicants, and all contact between applicants and MUSC should originate with this office. University Admissions makes all application forms accessible online, and staff are available to assist you in understanding prerequisite requirements, transcript submission, and additional application processes. Decisions regarding eligibility for admission and offers of admission are made solely through each College. However, all contact between applicants and MUSC should originate with Enrollment Management. Factors considered by programs in their admission decisions include the applicant's previous academic success, work previously completed, and cognitive and non-cognitive traits necessary and desirable in health professionals, health administrators, and/or biomedical scientists (e.g., leadership, compassion, teamwork, creativity, curiosity). MUSC values diversity among its applicants and in its student body. MUSC does not discriminate on the basis of race, color, creed, sex, age, national origin, disability, sexual orientation, gender identity, veteran status, or marital status in the administration of admission policies, educational policies, financial aid, or any other university activity. Any applicant needing assistance during any stage of the admission process is invited to contact the University Office of Admissions at oesadmis@musc.edu . Application filing deadlines vary by program. Information Privacy MUSC seeks to protect your personal information and complies with applicable state and federal regulations. Only authorized MUSC employees and officials acting on behalf of the university have access to materials submitted in support of your application to enroll at the university. Consideration for Admission To be reviewed and considered for admission, all applicants must file their application with a non-refundable processing fee. All materials submitted in support of the admission process become the exclusive property of MUSC and cannot be returned to the student or duplicated for any purpose. These materials usually include, but are not limited to, official transcripts of all prior graduate and undergraduate work, letters of recommendation, and national test scores. Applicants are only considered for the semester and the program they specify on the application form. Changes require an applicant to refile an application and to pay an additional filing fee. Deferrals in the anticipated enrollment date requested after acceptance of the admission offer are made only with the approval of the program involved. The accepted applicant must complete the applicant response form and pay the matriculation fee to hold their place in the program as well as meet any conditions of their acceptance. Academic preparation (in the form of transfer credits, diplomas, or degrees) required for entrance into any of the programs at MUSC must ordinarily have been earned at an institution accreditation by an organization recognized by the Department of Education. The admissions committee of a particular college at MUSC may consider an applicant from a non-accredited institution in competition with other applicants if it determines that the applicant’s academic preparation meets the entrance requirements of the college. In addition, the committee on admissions of the respective MUSC college may require a recognized examination such as the Scholastic Aptitude Test (SAT), the American College Test (ACT), the Medical College Admission Test (MCAT), the Graduate Record Examination (GRE), the Dental Admission Test (DAT), the Pharmacy College Admission Test (PCAT), the Test of English as a Foreign Language (TOEFL), and recognized national professional board examinations.

We asked her about resources for parents during this period of at-home learning. With the closing of K-12 schools across the state, parents are now more involved than ever in their children's education. What online resources are available through University Libraries that could support their efforts? The University Libraries at UofSC provide access to over 400 research databases(http://guides.library.sc.edu/az.php?a=all) . This huge collection of materials is available from home and covers every discipline and topic imaginable. In addition to the libraries’ regular online collections, some companies are also making access to their educational content free to facilitate learning from home during this period of uncertainty. Kathy Snediker, Research and Instruction Librarian at Thomas Cooper Library, has created an online guide(https://guides.library.sc.edu/library-support-covid/free-stuff) that highlights content recently made free. More information will be added to this guide as it becomes available. Does University Libraries have resources for all K-12 students, even the early elementary grades? The University Libraries provide access to many online K-12 resources.(http://guides.library.sc.edu/az.php?a=all&t=31489) These include quality educational materials suitable for elementary through high school grade levels. Students can use these resources to access narrated picture books and graphic novels, primary source materials, periodical content, reference materials at a variety of grade levels, and more. What tips would you offer to parents who want to nurture their children's sense of curiosity and tap into their digital native abilities to find information online? Most children know how to access information online, but they don’t always understand how to differentiate quality sources of information from those they should not trust. This problem may be amplified because children often get their news from social media(https://eric.ed.gov/?id=EJ1190639) . There’s a huge amount of misinformation online, and in the search for answers to their questions about COVID-19, for example, they may stumble upon inaccurate information. Parents can help steer their children toward quality sources of information. Library content is a great place to start. Parents can ask their children questions about the sources they choose when seeking information. Can the child tell who is responsible for content they find online and how old the content is? Why is the information being made available? Is it purely informational or are the content creators trying to sell a product? Are there any clues on the website about whether the content creators might be good sources of information on the topic? If children have questions about the accuracy of information they find online, pointing them toward objective, fact-checking sites such as Snopes(http://snopes.com) and Politifact(https://www.politifact.com/) can empower them to make determinations themselves. In addition to the resources offered above, the university's South Carolina Center for Community Literacy has assembled an online resource guide(https://sites.google.com/view/scccl-resources-covid19/home) for parents and teachers."", ""If you're only interested in online materials , you can select Available Online under Availability on the left.

62,Do I need to get a library card?,"[""“Sometimes that is what my job is,” she says. “It’s letting people feel free to say that does not exist in our community right now and to just be there with you while you're sad and try to help you figure out another way around it.” The services the library provides are unique because members of the community do not need a pre-existing reason to access its resources. If someone wants to see a social worker at their local hospital, they would need to be an admitted patient, but at the library, everyone is welcome. “You don't have to have a library card. You don't have to be a resident of Richland County,” says Patterson. “You just have to have a heartbeat to talk to us.”"", '“You don’t even have to have a library card to talk to us. You don’t have to be a resident of Richland County. You just have to have a heartbeat.” Lee Patterson, MSW ’12 “They’ve given me a lot of freedom to say, ‘OK, this is the need that we’re seeing right now, and this is how we think we should approach it’ and the freedom to go forth and see how we can help,” says Patterson, MSW ’12. The San Francisco Public Library became the first library system to employ a full-time social worker in 2009. Since then, over 50 public libraries around the country have followed suit, including Richland Library, which was highlighted in an NPR piece on the emerging trend in 2022. The media attention was warranted, but the work is ongoing — and expanding. For example, Patterson and her team want to work with the American Heart Association to provide access to blood pressure cuffs. They are also exploring options for helping homeless people with diabetes and also hope to revive the flu shot clinics they offered in the past. The library also provides a degree of privacy. “You can walk into a library, and a person driving by would never know if you’re coming to get a book, use the bathroom or see a social worker,” Patterson explains. That can be important, she says, when people have had negative experiences trying to access health care in the past. “There’s perception and then there’s the reality that our clients can come with,” Patterson explains. “They worry they’ll be treated differently, and we’ve had clients who have been treated differently, even when they have health insurance. We’ve watched nurses or other practitioners treat them differently.” It’s a different story at the library, where anyone can access services without judgment and without being admitted as a patient. “You don’t even have to have a library card to talk to us. You don’t have to be a resident of Richland County,” says Patterson. “You just have to have a heartbeat.” Carolinian Magazine This article was originally published in Carolinian, the alumni magazine for the University of South Carolina.

Reasons for an override that are not compelling include a) you want to take the course because you love the instructor or b) the course fits particularly well with your schedule. There are times that even a compelling reason for an override does not result in an override (e.g. the class you wish to take is at c a pacity a ccording to the fire code or because the academic unit is strict about class size). If an override is granted, an email will be sent notifying you, and you will have a limited time to respond (usually 24 hours).

75,What is the pass/fail option?,"['The pass/fail grading system is a standout feature. It reduces stress, fosters collaboration and allows for a healthier school-life balance.', 'If the NR is not resolved or replaced by the instructor with a valid end-of-term grade before the end of the major (Fall or Spring) term following the term for which the grade of NR was recorded, a grade of F will be assigned. Pass-Fail Option Unless there is an academic program exception explicitly approved by the Graduate Council, a graduate student may elect Pass-Fail grading in a course only if the content is outside the student’s major area of study and is not required on the program of study. This option permits enrichment of the student’s learning experience and a grade of either S (satisfactory) or U (unsatisfactory) will be awarded. Courses completed with a satisfactory grade may be counted toward total credit hours earned. A grade of U received under the individual Pass-Fail Option will be calculated into the cumulative grade point average as a grade of F . Students must have the approval of their academic program advisor and the dean of The Graduate School prior to registration. Academic Standard for Grade Point Average The cumulative grade point average (GPA) is defined as the GPA of all graduate credit courses recorded on the official USC transcript. In-date courses are ten or fewer years old for doctoral students and six or less years old for Master’s, specialist, graduate certificate, and nondegree students.', 'Pass/Fail.

Usage of the S/U (Pass-Fail) grading option is indicated in a course’s bulletin description. These courses do not affect a student’s grade point average. FN (Failure-Non Attendance) and UN (Unsatisfactory-Non Attendance) grades are assigned to students who never attended or have stopped attending class but have not officially dropped or withdrawn. Faculty are required to provide a last date of attendance when assigning this grade in order to determine the recalculation of awarded funds for financial aid recipients and the university. FN and UN grades are displayed and calculated as F and U grades on the official transcript. WF is assigned for student withdrawal from a course after the penalty deadline listed in academic and refund calendars on the registrar’s Web site. The grade of WF is treated as an F in the evaluation of grade point average computation. W is assigned for student withdrawal from a course after the late registration period but before the WF penalty date. Courses dropped during the late registration period (as published in academic and refund calendars) will not be recorded on a student’s permanent record. A grade of W will not enter into grade point average computation but will be recorded on a student’s permanent record. I, Incomplete, is assigned at the discretion of the instructor when, in the instructor’s judgment, a student is unable to complete some portion of the assigned work in a course because of an unanticipated illness, accident, work-related responsibility, family hardship, or verified learning disability. The grade of I is not intended to give students additional time to complete course assignments unless there is some indication that the specified condition or event prevented the student from completing course assignments on time. By arrangement with the instructor, the student will have up to 12 months in which to complete the work before a permanent grade is recorded. Re-enrolling in the course will not make up an Incomplete. An Assignment of Incomplete Grade form (AS-5) must be completed by the instructor and submitted to the Office of the University Registrar explaining the reason for the I and conditions for make-up. A grade of I is not computed in calculating a student’s grade point average. After 12 months, an I that has not been made up is changed to a grade of F or to the back-up grade indicated by the faculty member on the Assignment of Incomplete Grade form. NR , No Record, is assigned in the event that the grade is not available at the time final grades are submitted. It is a temporary mark on the transcript and must be replaced by a grade. If replacement does not occur before the last week of the spring or fall semester following the term for which the grade was recorded, a grade of F will be assigned. The NR is ignored in computing the GPA. Additional grade notations can be found on the Registrar Grade Point Scale website(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/transcripts_and_records/grade_point_scale/index.php) .

Information on Pass-Fail Grading can be found in the Undergraduate Studies Bulletin’s Academic Regulations Section(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/policies-regulations/undergraduate-academic-regulations/#text) . Grade Change Policy Grade changes based on transcription or computation errors should be reported directly to the Office of the University Registrar using the appropriate unit’s grade change form. Requests for a grade change must be submitted by the instructor no later than one calendar year from the date on which the grade was reported. Beyond this period, grade changes will be considered only in exceptional circumstances via petition procedure of the student’s college. Any other grade change request resulting from enrollment discrepancies, medical withdrawals, or perceived administrative errors must be submitted on the appropriate forms documentation to the dean of the student’s college for review through the petition procedure. This does not apply to the routine makeup and extension of an I (incomplete) and posting of a permanent grade to replace the recorded NR mark. Special makeup work or examinations to change grades already recorded are not permitted.

This option allows students to take certain courses outside their major area of study on a pass/fail basis, meaning they receive either a satisfactory (S) or unsatisfactory (U) grade instead of traditional letter grades. Courses taken with the pass/fail option do not impact a student's grade point average. However, it's essential to follow specific guidelines when utilizing the pass/fail grading system at the University of South Carolina, considering its importance in the overall grading policy?","The Pass-Fail program is designed to encourage students to investigate fields outside of their major curriculum in which they have a specific personal interest,without affecting their grade point average. The only grades assigned on courses taken under the Pass-Fail option are S and U; a grade of S indicates satisfactory performance,while a grade of U indicates unsatisfactory progress. A student will only be given credit for courses in which the grade of S is earned. You can elect the pass/fail option on an elective course by completing a Pass/Fail Form[pdf] available from the Office of the Registrar before the date specified in Master Schedule.

Any student intending to complete the requirements for graduation by attending summer school should contact the Office of the Law Registrar/Academic Services prior to registering for summer school. Accelerated Graduation by Attending Two Summer Sessions. Normally, students will obtain residence credit for the fall and spring semesters of each of their three years of law school and graduate in May of their third year. Students may elect, however, to accelerate their graduation by one semester (graduating in December of their third year rather than May) by attending two summer sessions. These two summer sessions taken together will qualify for one semester of residency if the following requirements are met: The student must enroll in two summer sessions and enroll in a minimum of six credit hours during each summer session. The student must satisfactorily complete at least 12 credit hours in the two sessions. Credit hours earned during Maymester may count toward the residency requirement. However, to receive residency credit, a student must complete at least one course during each of the two seven-week summer sessions. Credit for Summer School Courses Taken at Other Law Schools.

Undergraduate students can choose from over 90 minors offered by USC, including eight below offered by the College of Engineering and Computing. Who should minor in engineering or computing? A minor is generally an optional degree component. A minor allows you to specialize in an area related to your major, broaden your education and enhance your degree, or study something completely different if you have multiple interests. A minor shows employers and graduate schools that you are hardworking and can handle an additional workload. On top of that, an engineering or computing minor is a bonus form of experience for entering certain job markets. Declaring a minor will require you to complete around six classes in the minor field of study. These courses may be in addition to your major program of study or may overlap with some of your normal program requirements. Before adding a minor, determine if the minor will extend your time to graduation, and if so, if the valued added is worth it; it often is. If you think a minor might be right for you, talk with your advisor.

And with the pressure of trying to make friends and keep friends and do well academically, I think people forget about self-care and taking time keep their mental health strong.” Grover says it’s a lesson she has learned from her own counselors: how to listen better and interpret what people are trying to say. “My struggles have taught me how to help others,” she says. “I don’t have perfect mental health, but it definitely helps to be able to relate to situations and it makes people more comfortable talking to me, knowing that I've gone through some of the same things.” She says she has loved her time at USC, where she has taken advantage of the opportunities a large university offers while also developing close ties with friends and professors. “Coming into USC and knowing how big of a university it is, I was expecting huge, huge classes throughout freshman, sophomore, even into junior year. But I feel like USC does a really great job of having enough professors and small enough classes that you can really get to know your professors even as a freshman just starting out,” she says. And she has advice for students who will be starting as USC freshman in the fall: “First of all, take care of yourself. Make your happiness and your well-being your first priority. And then be involved and make college the best four years of your life.”""]","If you are concerned about a USC student's well-being, there are several resources available to help.
