4,Do prerequisites have to be enforced in Banner?,"Yes, prerequisites generally must be enforced in Banner when signing up for classes at the University of South Carolina. This means that if you want to register for a specific course, you typically need to have completed the required prerequisites first. The purpose of this system is to ensure that students have the necessary background knowledge and skills to succeed in more advanced courses.

However, there may be some situations where prerequisites can be waived. For instance, if you believe you have the appropriate knowledge or experience despite not meeting the prerequisites, you can discuss this with your academic advisor. If your advisor agrees, you can fill out a Request for Prerequisite Waiver form. If this request is approved, you will be allowed to sign up for the class even without fulfilling the prerequisites.

In case a class is full by the time you attempt to sign up for it, you can submit an Override Request (also known as the waitlist) form. The department will then try to increase the class size so that you can enroll in it. Keep in mind that similar procedures apply to overriding prerequisites for classes in other departments, such as math or physics.",complete,,0.3025132119655609,5,1,"Prerequisites do not have to be enforced in Banner.
