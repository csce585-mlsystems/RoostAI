These overlays focus on developing essential skills such as public speaking and information literacy, making them particularly valuable for students pursuing various disciplines.

When taking an Overlay course, students have the opportunity to meet two requirements within a single course – but at least one of these overlays must stand alone and not be used to satisfy other parts of the Carolina Core. It's important to consult your specific major checklist or consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're selecting the right Overlay courses to meet your degree requirements.

To give you an idea of what to look for, approved Carolina Core Overlay courses should address specific learning outcomes from the Carolina Core, such as those related to Communication Skills (CMS), Information Literacy (INF), or Values, Ethics, and Social Responsibility (VSR). Additionally, the college or department responsible for offering the course should demonstrate expertise in the content area associated with the learning outcome.

For example, if a student takes HIST 108, it can serve as both a Non-US History course and a VSR overlay, helping them progress toward their graduation goals. By understanding how Carolina Core Overlay courses work, students like you can make informed decisions about which classes will best support your academic success!","Carolina Core overlay courses meet two Carolina Core learning outcomes in one course.

Integrative Course Proposals An Integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum.', 'Integrative learning is more than just having the experience though and also includes learning from the experience and connecting learning to academic study.

Integrative learning goes beyond merely experiencing the material; it involves learning from the experience and connecting it to academic study. The final goal is applying the learned concepts to problem-solving and decision-making processes.

In the context of the University of South Carolina, integrative courses may include reflections, analysis of values, ethics, and social responsibility within the specific discipline area, service-learning opportunities, internships, or other field experiences that encourage study, reflection, and social action.

It is essential to carefully review their instructions and requirements. However, since you mentioned submitting a Letter of Intent instead of a full proposal, it is unlikely that a letter of concurrence would be necessary at this stage. Nevertheless, I recommend checking with your Sponsored Awards Management (SAM) representative at the University of South Carolina (USC) for clarification regarding your specific situation. They can provide guidance tailored to the funding opportunity and ensure compliance with USC policies.","Under ACAF 2.00: Interdisciplinary or Interprofessional Programs : Each instance in which an interdisciplinary or interprofessional program is created,revised,or terminated requires letters of concurrence from all related academic units.

Under ACAF 2.03: Course Actions : If a course action has the potential to impact the curriculum offering of other units or campuses,then the proponent is responsible for procuring concurrence from such units or campuses.

These dates impact how course changes affect tuition and fees, as well as textbook charges. Let me break down what each term means:

- **Drop:** This is the deadline for dropping a course without it appearing on your transcript. If you drop a course before this date, you will receive a full refund of tuition and fees, as well as any applicable textbook charges.

- **Add:** This is the deadline to add a new course to your schedule. After this date, you cannot add any additional courses for the semester.

- **Withdrawal (W):** This is the last day to withdraw from a course with a grade of 'W' on your transcript. Withdrawing after the drop date but before the withdrawal date will result in a partial refund of tuition and fees, but textbook charges will not be refunded.

To sum up, whether you get money back for dropped classes depends on the timing of the drop relative to the established drop/add/withdrawal dates for the given semester. To find the exact dates for the current or upcoming semesters, please consult the [USC Drop/Add/Refund Dates](https://banner.onecarolina.sc.edu/BannerExtensibility/customPage/page/z_spg_codes-dates?mepCode=COL) webpage.","The last day of drop/add is the last day you can drop a class without being assigned a W.
