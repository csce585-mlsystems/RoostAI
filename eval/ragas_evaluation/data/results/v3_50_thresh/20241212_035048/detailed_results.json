It's important to consult your specific major checklist or consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're selecting the right Overlay courses to meet your degree requirements.\n\nTo give you an idea of what to look for, approved Carolina Core Overlay courses should address specific learning outcomes from the Carolina Core, such as those related to Communication Skills (CMS), Information Literacy (INF), or Values, Ethics, and Social Responsibility (VSR). Additionally, the college or department responsible for offering the course should demonstrate expertise in the content area associated with the learning outcome.\n\nFor example, if a student takes HIST 108, it can serve as both a Non-US History course and a VSR overlay, helping them progress toward their graduation goals.

    "query": "What does each drop/add/w date mean? Will I still get money back for dropped classes?",
    "response": "The drop/add/withdrawal (W) dates refer to specific deadlines within each academic semester at the University of South Carolina (USC). These dates impact how course changes affect tuition and fees, as well as textbook charges. Let me break down what each term means:\n\n- **Drop:** This is the deadline for dropping a course without it appearing on your transcript. If you drop a course before this date, you will receive a full refund of tuition and fees, as well as any applicable textbook charges.\n\n- **Add:** This is the deadline to add a new course to your schedule. After this date, you cannot add any additional courses for the semester.\n\n- **Withdrawal (W):** This is the last day to withdraw from a course with a grade of 'W' on your transcript. Withdrawing after the drop date but before the withdrawal date will result in a partial refund of tuition and fees, but textbook charges will not be refunded.\n\nTo sum up, whether you get money back for dropped classes depends on the timing of the drop relative to the established drop/add/withdrawal dates for the given semester. To find the exact dates for the current or upcoming semesters, please consult the [USC Drop/Add/Refund Dates](https://banner.onecarolina.sc.edu/BannerExtensibility/customPage/page/z_spg_codes-dates?mepCode=COL) webpage.",

It may result in a lower grade point average (GPA) and could potentially place you on academic probation if your cumulative GPA falls below certain thresholds. However, it's important to remember that one failed class does not necessarily mean you will be dismissed from the university.\n\nIf you find yourself failing a class, consider speaking with your professor to discuss possible solutions or strategies for improving your performance. You might also want to reach out to an academic advisor who can help guide you through this situation and provide resources such as tutoring services or study groups.\n\nRemember, handling a failed class early on can prevent further academic difficulties down the road.
