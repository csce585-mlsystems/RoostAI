1,Can a program include more than one concentration?,"In the specific case of the Ph.D. in Marine Science program at the University of South Carolina, applicants can indeed apply to more than one concentration simultaneously. However, it's essential to note that once admitted into the program, students must choose only one concentration for their studies. This means that while you can express interest in multiple concentrations during the application process, you will eventually need to focus on just one of them for your degree requirements.",complete,,3.9918374104933303,5,3,"Yes,programs may have multiple concentrations within the major."
2,Can I choose specific (prescribed) courses as part of the Carolina Core for my program?,"Yes, you can choose specific courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program at the University of South Carolina. The Carolina Core consists of required courses with uniform learning outcomes that apply to all students, regardless of their major. While there are certain prescribed courses within each category of the Carolina Core, you have the flexibility to select from a variety of approved options that best align with your interests and academic goals. It's essential to review the list of courses satisfying Carolina Core requirements on the university's website and consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're making the most informed decisions for your educational journey. Keep in mind that courses used to satisfy Carolina Core requirements may not also be used to fulfill minor requirements.",complete,,6.278334048542663,5,5,Yes. Certain programs may require courses that are approved as Carolina Core foundational courses. It makes sense that those programs would “prescribe” those courses as required for the particular Carolina Core component that they fulfill.
3,Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,"When making changes to a cross-listed course, it is essential to consider how these alterations may impact any associated cross-listed courses. However, whether all changes directly affect the cross-listed courses depends on the nature of the modifications. For instance, if there are adjustments to prerequisites, corequisites, or cross-listings themselves, then those changes will undoubtedly influence the connected courses. On the other hand, minor edits to the course description without affecting the course content, learning objectives, or assessment methods might not necessarily impact the cross-listed courses.

In terms of syllabi submission for cross-listed courses, it is required when introducing new courses or significantly changing course descriptions, Carolina Core or GLD designations, or delivery modes to over 50% online. This policy ensures that any substantial modifications undergo thorough examination and approval before implementation.

Lastly, regarding course bulletin descriptions and cross-listing submissions, it is crucial to ensure that all cross-listed courses have been uploaded timely and their bulletin descriptions are identical. This consistency facilitates a smooth review process and helps maintain the integrity of the academic offerings at the University of South Carolina.",complete,,5.252473263307051,5,3,Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Getting approval for distributed learning for one cross-listed course does not automatically approve cross listed courses for distributed learning delivery.

4,Do prerequisites have to be enforced in Banner?,"No, prerequisites do not necessarily have to be enforced in Banner during registration. However, it's essential to ensure that you meet all the prerequisites of the courses you intend to take. This is because Banner may prevent you from registering if you haven't satisfied the necessary prerequisites.

If you find yourself in a situation where you don't meet the prerequisites for a specific course, there might still be an opportunity to request an override. To learn more about overrides and their corresponding forms, consult the appropriate resources provided by the University of South Carolina.

Ultimately, discussing your concerns with your academic advisor is highly recommended. They can assess your situation and guide you through the process of obtaining a prerequisite waiver or override if needed.",complete,,2.8688427123156464,5,3,"Prerequisites do not have to be enforced in Banner. However,it is recommended that they be enforced,as they are published in the Bulletin. It creates inconsistency in University sources to list prerequisites on the Bulletin,but then not enforce them in Banner."
5,How do Carolina Core Overlay courses work?,"Carolina Core Overlay courses are a unique type of course at the University of South Carolina that allows students to fulfill multiple requirements with just one class. These overlays focus on developing essential skills such as public speaking and information literacy, making them particularly valuable for students pursuing various disciplines.

When taking an Overlay course, students have the opportunity to meet two requirements within a single course – but at least one of these overlays must stand alone and not be used to satisfy other parts of the Carolina Core. It's important to consult your specific major checklist or consult with your academic advisor to ensure you're selecting the right Overlay courses to meet your degree requirements.

To give you an idea of what to look for, approved Carolina Core Overlay courses should address specific learning outcomes from the Carolina Core, such as those related to Communication Skills (CMS), Information Literacy (INF), or Values, Ethics, and Social Responsibility (VSR). Additionally, the college or department responsible for offering the course should demonstrate expertise in the content area associated with the learning outcome.

For example, if a student takes HIST 108, it can serve as both a Non-US History course and a VSR overlay, helping them progress toward their graduation goals. By understanding how Carolina Core Overlay courses work, students like you can make informed decisions about which classes will best support your academic success!",complete,,8.630379073267436,5,5,"Carolina Core overlay courses meet two Carolina Core learning outcomes in one course.

41,What does each drop/add/w date mean? Will I still get money back for dropped classes?,"The drop/add/withdrawal (W) dates refer to specific deadlines within each academic semester at the University of South Carolina (USC). These dates impact how course changes affect tuition and fees, as well as textbook charges. Let me break down what each term means:

- **Drop:** This is the deadline for dropping a course without it appearing on your transcript. If you drop a course before this date, you will receive a full refund of tuition and fees, as well as any applicable textbook charges.

- **Add:** This is the deadline to add a new course to your schedule. After this date, you cannot add any additional courses for the semester.

- **Withdrawal (W):** This is the last day to withdraw from a course with a grade of 'W' on your transcript. Withdrawing after the drop date but before the withdrawal date will result in a partial refund of tuition and fees, but textbook charges will not be refunded.

To sum up, whether you get money back for dropped classes depends on the timing of the drop relative to the established drop/add/withdrawal dates for the given semester. To find the exact dates for the current or upcoming semesters, please consult the [USC Drop/Add/Refund Dates](https://banner.onecarolina.sc.edu/BannerExtensibility/customPage/page/z_spg_codes-dates?mepCode=COL) webpage.",complete,,4.14439546844385,5,5,"The last day of drop/add is the last day you can drop a class without being assigned a W.

You might also want to reach out to an academic advisor who can help guide you through this situation and provide resources such as tutoring services or study groups.
