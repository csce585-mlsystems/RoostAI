Foundational courses are taken early in the undergraduate experience and apply across disciplines. Integrative courses are taken near the end of study and apply to discipline-specific majors. Colleges and programs will also have specific requirements in each major and in some cases will have a list of recommended Carolina Core courses. Faculty members teaching a foundational Carolina Core course will need to adopt the relevant Carolina Core learning outcomes particular to that class. All Carolina Core courses must cover the learning outcomes identified in the template syllabi of approved Core courses. Instructors may add additional course content, but the essential outcomes must be covered. An interactive list of Faculty Senate-approved courses meeting the Carolina Core requirements is available online. Prototypical syllabi are available for all Carolina Core courses. They include student achievements and illustrate options for tailoring the syllabi for individual classes.

The Core begins with foundational courses early in the undergraduate experience, followed by one or more integrative courses near the end in which selected Core learning outcomes are integrated into the chosen major. Each of the ten Core components must be met with a Core-approved course. While most Core-approved courses fulfill a single Core component, a few courses, called overlay-eligible courses, have been approved to fulfill two Core components. Every student is required to complete a minimum of 31 credit hours of Core-approved courses. Transfer students who enter USC Columbia, Lancaster, Salkehatchie, Sumter, or Union are subject to the Carolina Core requirements.

The proposal should include the range of hours, number of times the course can be taken for credit and the maximum number of credit hours that can be applied to the degree. The Number of times the course can be taken for credit is not how many attempts a student can have to pass the course, but is how many times it can be taken, usually under different topics or studies. Example: Credit hours minimum for a single offering is 1. Credit hours maximum for a single offering is 6. Number of times the course can be taken is 6. Number of credit hours if course can be taken multiple times is 12. Is this all correct in the proposal?

The Center for Teaching Excellence determined that students at USC would benefit by having a greater variety of high-quality Distributed Learning (DL) course options for fulfilling their Core requirements. DL courses include fully online and blended courses (courses that meet in a traditional classroom, studio, or lab for up to 50% of the instruction and deliver the remaining instruction online.) With support from the Office of the Provost, CTE invited full time faculty at the USC Columbia or the Palmetto College campuses to submit proposals for the development of exemplary Carolina Core courses for distributed learning (DL) delivery. Four proposals were selected to receive Carolina Core Online: Teaching Innovation Grants in Distributed Learning Course Development for the 2016-2017 school year. In addition to funding of $6,000, grant recipients receive expert instructional design assistance, pedagogical resources, and technological support to convert existing Core courses for DL delivery. All the proposals selected this year are for the development of fully online asynchronous courses in which 100% of the instruction is offered online, with no required synchronous class meetings. Two proposals focus on transforming film and media face-to-face courses to fully online classes. Mark Minett’s class, Introduction to Film and Media Studies (FAMS 240) is a foundation course that meets the Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding Carolina Core outcome. Introducing students to the study of moving image media, students in this course analyze and discuss numerous examples of film, television, and web-based media. As such, online delivery will enhance learner opportunities to access these materials. Mark Cooper will develop for online delivery, Film and Media History (FAMS 300) which fulfills the Global Citizenship and Multicultural Understanding: Historical Thinking requirement in the Carolina Core. Through videos highlighting key issues and examples from the past two millennia of media history, Dr. Cooper will provide students well beyond the Columbia campus with a rich learning experience that was previously available only to students in the traditional face-to-face course. Also fulfilling the Global Citizenship and Multicultural Understanding: Historical Thinking requirement in the Carolina Core is Kathryn “Kay” Edwards’ course European History from Ancient Times to Mid-Seventeenth Century (HIST 101). Having taught this course face-to-face for many years, she looks forward to incorporating rich digital resources and interactive web-based materials into the curriculum, encouraging students to assess sources critically and appreciate how these sources form our narratives about the past. Carla A. Pfeffer’s project will transform the popular Sociology of Sex Role into a fully online course. In this course, students develop an understanding of the ways in which sex, gender, race, class, sexuality, age, ability, and other factors shape the experiences and opportunities of both individuals and groups. The traditional version of Sociology of Sex Roles often fills to capacity within the first week of enrollment, frequently generating a waiting list of interested students. Offering this course in an online format will respond to student demand and provide additional opportunities for students to access this important course. Karen E.

What Makes up my Program of Study? In the College of Arts and Sciences, your program of study consists of the following requirements: Carolina Core, College Requirements, Electives, Program courses, Major courses, and either a Minor or Cognate. CAS programs require between 120 to 128 credit hours to graduate, depending upon your major. Learn more about the requirements below. Carolina Core The Carolina Core(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/) is a set of requirements that students across the University of South Carolina have to complete as part of their program of study. The Carolina Core is made up of 10 core components, each with a learning outcome and credit hour requirements. Click below on each requirement to learn more. You can find the entire list of Carolina Core applicable courses, as well as the requirements that they fulfill in the most recent academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/carolina-core-courses/#foundationalcoursestext) . College Requirements The College Requirements are different from the Carolina Core, in that they are only required for the specific college in which you are studying. While looking at the separate components of the Carolina Core above, you may have noticed that there is some overlap between Carolina Core and College Requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences. Click on each College Requirement below to learn more. For more information on the College Requirements, follow the link to the College of Arts and Sciences College Requirements on the academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/arts-sciences/#text) . Expand all Additional Humanities Every student within the College of Arts and Sciences is required to take at least one additional Humanities class. Students who are pursuing a BS are only required to take 3 hours of additional Humanities, while students who are pursuing a BA are required to take 9 hours of Additional Humanities (3 classes). Please see your advisor for a list of applicable courses. Founding Documents The Founding Documents requirement is required for students who entered USC in Fall 2021 or later. There are seven courses that can apply go towards this requirement, and they focus on America’s Founding Documents and works about African American’s struggles for freedom. Learn more about the Founding Documents requirement(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/internal/undergrad_students/founding_documents.php) . Expand all Tip: Have you taken HIST 111 to satisfy one of your GHS requirements? If so, HIST 111 will also count towards the Founding Documents requirement! The Founding Documents requirement is the only other place in your program of study besides the overlay, where one course can fulfill two requirements. Talk to your advisor about how to make the most out of the classes you take! Foreign Language As stated in the GFL section of the Carolina Core, as a CAS student, you will need to reach the 122 level of foreign language of your choice. How many hours of foreign language you will have to take is dependent on your Foreign Language Placement Test(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) score. You must register in advance to take this Placement test. Once you have your score, your advisor will help you register(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) for the appropriate foreign language class. Social Science As part of the CAS College Requirements, you will need one GSS Carolina Core and an additional Social Sciences class. While any of the GSS courses can apply towards this requirement, you can always ask your advisor for a list of applicable courses. U.S. History/Non-U.S. History The College of Arts and Sciences requires you to take both a US History class, as well as a Non-U.S. History class. One will count towards your Carolina Core GHS requirement and the second will apply towards your GHS College Requirement. (It doesn’t matter which goes where, just that both are completed.)']","Carolina Core Overlay courses allow you to meet two learning outcomes with a single course, which helps reduce the overall number of credit hours needed to complete the Carolina Core requirements. These courses are specially designated to cover material from two different learning outcomes. It's essential to note that the maximum number of overlays you can use to fulfill the Carolina Core requirements is two. The context information provides various links to the Carolina Core courses, requirements, and overlay-eligible courses, which could be useful to consult for more details on specific overlay courses.","Carolina Core overlay courses meet two Carolina Core learning outcomes in one course. Students may apply a maximum of two overlay courses to their Carolina Core hours. All students must have a minimum of 31 hours of Carolina Core.

3,How do I change my program learning outcomes?,"[""Learning outcomes describe the measurable skills, abilities, knowledge or values that students should be able to demonstrate as a result of completing a course. They are student-centered rather than teacher-centered, in that they describe what the students will do, not what the instructor will teach. All learning outcomes should be measurable and use action verbs (see Action Words for Bloom’s Taxonomy).(https://www.citadel.edu/ceitl/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/Blooms-Taxonomy-for-Creating-Outcomes.pdf) For more on Learning Outcomes and program-specific examples, visit CTE Learning Outcomes(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/course_design_development_delivery/learning_outcomes/) . Sample Language for a Syllabus After successful completion of this course, you will be able to: Analyze diverse texts across genres and media. Apply strategies for close reading and critical analysis. Create comprehensive writing processes - including invention, planning, drafting, revision, and editing. Develop effective college-level expository and analytical essays. Evaluate the reliability and credibility of sources in academic writing. Discuss course texts and papers in progress. Develop a writing style appropriate for academic audiences that is clear, effective, and free of major errors. For Distributed Learning Courses Include a statement in this section verifying that “The learning outcomes are equivalent to those of a face-to-face (F2F) version of the course.” * Instructional Methods Describe what students should expect in regard to your instructional methods. The description may include your lecture format, group work, presentation, the use of instructional technology and the use of the Blackboard Learning Management system. Sample Language for a Syllabus The course will be taught using multiple instructional methods. These methods will include lecture, group projects and oral presentations with an associated critical discussion. Typically, course topics will be introduced via a 2-3 lecture format incorporating interpretive discussions. Directly following the lecture presentation, you will receive an article from the primary literature that either illustrates current research on the topic or explores a related or relevant additional concept. Literature discussions will utilize small group discussions followed by classroom presentation and discussion. For Distributed Learning Courses Describe what students should expect from the course format. The description may include expectations of an online course versus a face-to-face course, the structure of weekly modules, and an overview of expected learning activities. Sample Language for a Syllabus This is a fully online course. Online classes are not easier than face-to-face lecture classes. To succeed in an online class, you must be extremely motivated and well-organized. You must purchase the required textbook listed above by the first day of the course. Other course materials are available via Blackboard (“Bb”). Regular Internet access is essential for successful completion of the course. The typical class structure will consist of learning modules, which include: Short Video/PowerPoint Lectures Readings Online Discussions Group Projects Video Presentations Exams Field Exercises Written Exercises This is an entirely Web-based course. We have no face-to-face class meetings, and you will complete your work asynchronously – which simply means that you will be working on it at different times than your colleagues. It is important to understand that this is not a self-paced class or an independent study. You will have assigned deadlines, and work must be submitted on time. You may not save up your assignments to complete in the last weeks or days of the semester. One critical part of this class is regular interaction with other students and with me, your instructor. Each assignment sequence must be completed on schedule – you can't work ahead or get behind and be successful. * Course Communication and Feedback Describe the method and turnaround time of course communications and feedback. Sample Language for a Syllabus I will communicate with you regarding grades and assignments. If you need to contact me, the best method is via email. Generally, I will reply to emails within 24 hours and will provide feedback on assignments within 72 hours. You may also post questions pertaining to the course on the Blackboard Discussion Board. These questions will be answered within 24 hours. If you are having trouble with this course or its material, you should contact me via email to discuss the issues. Announcements will be posted to this course whenever necessary. If there is any other information that I think is important, then I will send it to your email address listed in Blackboard."", ""Learning Outcomes - Center for Teaching Excellence | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Center for Teaching Excellence SC.edu About Offices and Divisions Center for Teaching Excellence Teaching Resources Course Design, Development and Delivery Learning Outcomes Learning Outcomes Learning outcomes describe the measurable skills, abilities, knowledge or values that students should be able to demonstrate as a result of a completing a course.

Expand all Assessment Best Practices for Online Courses There are practical considerations you need to make regarding assessments, course management, and time based on the size of your class, discipline, and whether you have teaching assistant support for grading. The assessments you choose and the grade percentage you assign them indicate to your students what you want them to learn, so make sure your assessments are sending the right message. Assessments should connect to your course learning outcomes – the action verb you use will indicate what type of assessment you apply. An instructional designer can provide you options to help you select the assessment types best suited for these considerations, based on your course learning outcomes. Consider allowing students to submit assignments online in different ways: record a video of themselves discussing the answer, photo of their handwritten notes or work, etc. – numerous educational technology options exist for formative assessments and individual feedback. Low-stakes, Formative Assessment Strategies: Many formative assessments done in F2F settings are very adaptable for incorporating into the online environment. Small group activities, partner-work problem-solving, short answer responses, etc. can be done using tools in Blackboard (tests, assignments, discussion boards), online educational technologies and other assessment tools. These low-stakes assessment techniques can be included as or part of weekly quizzes or other low-stakes assessments, assignments, or group discussion summaries. Certain grading scales lend themselves to more efficient grading, especially for low-stakes assignments. For example, it can be easier to decide if a short in-class paper deserves a mark of “check-plus” or “check-minus "" compared to determining whether it deserves a numerical or letter grade. Examples of good low stakes active learning strategies that can be modified for class assessments can be found in these websites: Active Learning Examples of Classroom Assessment Techniques for Classes(http://www.schreyerinstitute.psu.edu/pdf/2011-10-13-10430-CATs_for_Large_Classes.pdf) High-stake Tests and Summative Assessments: Organize tests and summative assessments in such a way to allow students multiple opportunities to learn and show mastery or evidence of progress throughout the term, and not just at the end of the semester. Writing test questions: Use Bloom’s Taxonomy Table(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/docs/learning_outcomes_taxonomy_table.pdf) to help you craft multiple-choice questions that address the higher levels of application or learning you desire. Include case studies, problem sets whose questions build on each other with respect to thought processes and strategies. Test Pools and Test Builder: Create tests from Test Pools and use the Blackboard Test Builder to streamline and shorten your exam development time. Automatic grading: Blackboard has numerous functionalities for automatic grading and feedback options. Use Peer Review and Peer Assessments for Grading Students are perfectly capable of supplying feedback for each other. Peer review not only takes some of the pressure off you as being the sole feedback-giver, it also is a great formative learning experience for students and helps them more critically assess their own work. Peer review is an important and vital aspect of building community and enhancing social presence in online courses. With peer review, students are tasked to consider the amount, level, value, worth, quality or success of the products or outcomes of learning of peers of similar status (Topping, 1998). Peer review is a process where students communicate with one another and participate in dialogue related to performance and standards (Liu & Carless, 2006).']","To change your program learning outcomes, you should follow these steps:

1. Review the current learning outcomes and identify areas that need improvement or modification.
2. Consult with important stakeholders, including university administration, faculty, students, alumni, and community members, to ensure agreement on the changes.
3. Ensure the learning outcomes are SMART: Specific, Measurable, Agreed Upon, Realistic, and Time-Framed.
4. Align the program learning outcomes with the institution's mission, goals, and Carolina Core learning outcomes.
5. Update the program syllabi and course learning outcomes to reflect the changes in program learning outcomes.
6. Communicate the changes to all relevant parties, including current and prospective students, faculty, and staff.
7. Monitor the effectiveness of the new learning outcomes and make adjustments as needed.

Keep in mind that changing program learning outcomes might require approval from the university administration or other governing bodies.

The School Director is responsible for implementing the change. PROCEDURE : The initiator will present the recommendation for a new course or course change to the Curriculum Committee. Full documentation (i.e. description, hours, etc.) must accompany the proposal. The Curriculum Committee will consider the proposal and present a recommendation to the entire faculty at the next scheduled faculty meeting. Faculty may approve the proposal in which case the proposal will be forwarded to the School’s Director who is responsible for sending to the appropriate University committee. Faculty may also disapprove the proposal or faculty may refer the proposal back to the Curriculum Committee for change and resubmission to the faculty. The Director is responsible for tracking curriculum changes at the University level and then seeing that those changes are implemented within the School. D Expand all Distinguished Alumni and Award for Service - D20 Date: April 25, 2003 Revised: December 15, 2008 POLICY: The School’s Distinguished Alumni Awards were established to recognize former students of the School who have achieved significant recognition in the field of journalism and mass communications. The Dean and Director’s Award for Service is to recognize contributions by Alumni to the School. PROCEDURE : The School has two Distinguished Alumni Awards. The Distinguished Alumnus Award is for graduates who have been out of school for more than 10 years and whose careers represent significant professional achievement. The Outstanding Young Alumnus award is for graduates who have been out of school 10 years or less but who have already demonstrated significant professional accomplishments early in their careers. Alumni selected for the awards are initially nominated by faculty or alumni of the School in the spring semester of the year of recognition. A two-thirds vote of the faculty is required for a nominee to be named a recipient of one of the awards. While anyone may nominate someone for the Dean and Director’s Award for Service, the Director and Dean select the honoree.

PROCEDURE : During a crisis, the Director’s Office (803 777-6791) will serve as the input point for receiving word of an emergency originating outside the building and will coordinate the response to any emergency that originates inside the building. Should an emergency occur during a normal business day when classes are in session, the Director’s office will notify the dean, associate dean, directors and sequence heads in person or by telephone. Such individuals would physically move through the School’s section of the Coliseum and alert students, staff and faculty. If an emergency requiring action to protect individuals or equipment or records originates outside normal business hours, the Dean and/or other top College/School official will alert appropriate personnel. Because the Coliseum serves as an authorized emergency shelter, the facility can be expected to attract people, both within and without the University community, to seek shelter. All would seek safety away from the windows on the academic level. Internal threats would normally require immediate evacuation via the nearest exit. Periodic fire drills coordinated by the Director and campus police should prepare students, faculty and staff for quick and orderly evacuation of the building. In the case of an internal threat of violence or criminal behavior, notification would be via telephones and e-mail, with only the Director, or his/her representative, moving through the building to alert students and staff. If the threat is deemed widespread, then students, staff and faculty will be advised to move to the nearest secure area with a communication device and wait out the threat. With the possibility of power outages, each faculty and staff office is equipped with a flashlight. Staff and faculty will be expected to monitor, and assist with, evacuation of the building during a power failure.

Carolina Core Courses Designating a foundational course as Carolina Core Designating a course as Carolina Core requires approval by the Carolina Core Committee. For a new course submitted in APPS, complete the Carolina Core information. If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, a course change proposal must be submitted in APPS with the Carolina Core information completed. Integrative Course Proposals An Integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. As a result, regulatory oversight is ceded predominantly to the academic unit. A department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporates one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes such that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course. The following is the process to designate or delete an Integrative course. Add an Integrative Course Submit a new course proposal or course change proposal as appropriate in APPS. In the justification section, provide the following information: Carolina Core Integrative Course, Major Name, Degree (e.g., ANTH 444, Anthropology, B.S.) and explain which Carolina Core Learning outcomes(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/faculty-and-staff/learning-outcomes.php) are met by the course and how the course meets the Carolina Core Learning outcome(s). No syllabus is required. Delete an Integrative Course For deletions of only the Integrative Course designation (not the whole course), submit a course change proposal in APPS and state in the justification that the Integrative Course designation is being deleted. Upon Approval in Faculty Senate, the Integrative Course will be scribed into Degree Works. The Office of Academic Programs will also report the information to the Office of the Provost to ensure that the Carolina Core website is updated and the records in the Office of the Provost are updated.', 'Proposing Core Courses - Office of the Provost | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Office of the Provost SC.edu About Offices and Divisions Office of the Provost Our Offices Undergraduate Studies Carolina Core For Faculty and Staff Proposing Core Courses Proposing Core Courses Any member of the faculty is welcome to propose new Core courses or changes to previously approved courses.

8,What are the requirements for a syllabus?,"['Steps to a Good Syllabus - Center for Teaching Excellence | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Center for Teaching Excellence SC.edu About Offices and Divisions Center for Teaching Excellence Teaching Resources Syllabus Templates Steps to a Good Syllabus Steps to a Good Syllabus Because students will view the syllabus as a kind of ""contract,"" it is important to be as clear as possible, and to avoid changing major aspects of the syllabus after the first day of class. In deciding what to include in the syllabus, first include all information that students need to have at the beginning of the course. Second, include all information that students need to have in writing. There is no hard-and-fast rule about the proper length for a syllabus. If in doubt, it is usually best to err on the long side, to ensure that important course information is fully covered. At the same time, students will appreciate having key information in succinct form on the first page. Expand all 1. Get Started Before you start writing your syllabus, think first and foremost about the knowledge and skills students should gain in your course, then about how you will assess these knowledge and skills, and finally about the best ways for the students to learn them. Focusing on learning outcomes, rather than a list of topics to cover, generally results in a more satisfying course for you and your students. Organize the syllabus logically, and use consistent (underlined or bold-faced headings) to help students find information. We recommended that the syllabus be created in three main parts: (1) Course Description, (2) Course Outline, and (3) Policies and Procedures. Creating each of these parts separately gives you a set of three documents that can be easily adapted or directly reused for other courses taught 2. The Course Overview Section The course description components of the syllabus should not be changed during the running of the course. A well constructed one or two page document is usually sufficient to include the following: The Course Title, Course Number, and Semester Instructor Contact Information Office Hours and Location Course Meeting Location and Times Course Description(http://bulletin.sc.edu/content.php?catoid=37&navoid=798) Learning Outcomes Required Textbooks or Readings 3. Course Requirements and Grading The course requirements and grading section should include the following: Assignments and/or exams with brief descriptions of expectations and values for each. Grading scheme and weights including what a student must do to receive a grade of A to F. Syllabi for courses at the 500 or 600 levels must contain an explanation of the differences in requirements for graduate and undergraduate credit. Graduate students should be required to complete additional graduate level work (e.g., a research paper and/or substantive additional reading), and should be evaluated on a more rigorous basis than undergraduate students. Topical outline of content to be covered A time allocation framework (e.g., week 1, week 2, etc. to include at least 14 weeks for a standard academic year course session) 4. The Course Outline Section The course outline is a part of the syllabus that may be subject to change as the semester progresses. For example, a topic students find more difficult than anticipated may require additional time, or weather conditions may cancel sessions. Changes should be kept to a minimum, be reasonable and justified, and notice provided in a timely manner. A course outline can be presented on a separate sheet or as a separate file online, and can include: Topics and Timeline Reading Assignments Due Dates for Assignments Test and Exam Dates Some instructors like to outline their course in a date-by-date list, others with a general list without reference to specific dates, and still others with a calendar style. Examples for these approaches can be found as Syllabus Templates. 5. The Policies and Procedures Section Course Expectations are policies and procedures that describe how you will treat students. What you include and how it is stated will influence your classroom’s climate. It is therefore important not only to state what you expect of students, but to explain why. It is also recommended that you include a statement of what the students can expect from you. Since there is a good chance that your expectations of students will be the same in most of the classes you teach, it is a good idea to create your policies and procedures as a single document that you can reuse.', 'Is the offering colleges/department expert in the content pertaining to the learning outcome? If course content potentially overlaps with content offered by another program, has a letter of concurrence been provided? Policy Statements Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding academic integrity? Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding attendance policy? Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding students with disabilities? Evaluation Does this syllabus specify assignments, projects, quizzes, and/or exams with brief descriptions of expectations and points/weights assigned to each activity? Does the syllabus clearly indicate the grading scale, weight of each assignment (points or percentage), and how grades will be assigned? If standard grades are used, does the syllabus indicate how letters A-F will be assigned (by points or percentage)? (Note: the grades of B+, C+, D+, and F+ are permitted but A+ and ""minus"" grades are not.) If pass/fail grades are an option does the syllabus indicate the minimum grade (points, percentage) required for a ""pass""? 500/600 level course? If this is 500/600 level course: Does the syllabus indicate separate grading scheme for graduate students? Does the syllabus include one or more requirements for graduate credit that are clearly differentiated from undergraduate assignments? Graduate work is normally evaluated on a more rigorous basis than that of undergraduate work. Does the syllabus provide different grading criteria for graduate students (typically based on distinct assignment) equivalent to one letter grade if not done (e.g., student cannot earn an A if not completed)? Course Outline/Schedule and Materials (All Courses) Does the syllabus include a citation for required reading/material? Does the syllabus include information about how to access any third-party software or tools that may be required? Does the syllabus include a statement of compliance with copyright polices, e.g., ""All readings/materials comply with copyright/fair use policies""? Does the syllabus include an appropriate module-by-module or unit-by-unit schedule for course topics and activities? Course Outline/Schedule and Materials (If >50% Online) Does the syllabus include a statement such as ""All learning outcomes in this Distributed Learning course are equivalent to face-to-face (F2F) version of this course."" ? Does the syllabus include an overview of how the course will be conducted--e.g., ""This course is an asynchronous online course. Students will work at different times from different locations and will not be required to attend any face-to-face (F2F) or synchronous meetings at the same time. The Project Alert software must be utilized for the projects in this class. All students must download if from the publisher’s website at https://project.alert.software/download.html""? Does the include a statement of expectations regarding communication/feedback turnaround time on discussion board postings, emails, assignments, etc.? Does the syllabus include a statement regarding the specific platforms/technologies/software used in the course--e.g., ""online lectures will be provided through Adobe Connect Professional. Therefore, students must have access to the Internet to view/hear lectures. No special software is required. Students will also submit all assignments and take all quizzes/tests through Blackboard""? Does the syllabus indicate the minimum student technical requirements/skills required by the course? Does the module outline demonstrate that students will be expected to expend approximately the same amount of total time and effort per credit hour as they would in a traditional face-to-face version of the course? (Note: for a traditional course the expectation is 700 minutes--14 hours--of classroom instruction with twice that amount--at least 28 hours--of supplementary academic work outside the classroom per each credit hour). Cross-Lists? If so: Have all cross-listed courses been uploaded in time to be considered within a single review cycle? Are the course bulletin descriptions identical? Are the learning objectives identical? Are Carolina Core, GLD, etc. designations identical? Are the grade modes identical? Are the schedule types identical? Are pre/co-reqs the same? Is there a letter of concurrence from each department? Is there a syllabus from each department? Challenge the conventional. Create the exceptional.

Include a grading policy that is clearly stated and includes the grading scale, weights of each graded assignment, and explanation of how grades (A-F) will be assigned. The Pass-Fail grading option is an option that can be selected by students for a course. If students select this option, performance in the course does not affect their grade point average. If Pass-Fail is an option for your course, your syllabus must indicate the minimum grade (points, percentage) required for a “pass”. Required only for 500-600 level courses : Different requirements for undergraduate versus graduate credit should be clearly identified in two distinct grading scales. According to ACAF 2.03, ""Course syllabi must specify how the requirements for the course are quantitatively and qualitatively different for undergraduate and graduate credit.

Integrative learning at USC is about making connections across within and beyond the classroom experiences and includes student engagement in community service, research, peer leadership, internships, and study abroad. Integrative learning is more than just having the experience though and also includes learning from the experience and connecting learning to academic study. The final step is applying learning to solve problems and make decisions . . . applying learning to lead. USC students’ educational experiences are enriched by engagement within and beyond the classroom and their ability to connect these experiences is the heart of a truly meaningful education. CIEL promotes student opportunities to engage beyond the classroom and synthesize and apply learning across experiences. Graduation with Leadership Distinction is the Center’s signature program and recognizes students for significant engagement and learning, including leadership through solution-oriented thinking. Experiential Learning is also encouraged for all undergraduate students. Mission To advance integrative and experiential learning across within and beyond the classroom experiences at the University of South Carolina Columbia and Palmetto College campuses for students, faculty, and staff by providing programs, developing resources, conducting outreach, and facilitating assessment. Vision To foster an enriched educational environment through purposeful within and beyond the classroom experiences that deepen the impact on student learning and enhance their preparation for the future.

No Limits.', 'Damien Picarello Charles Pierce, Associate Professor, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (ECIV 101: Introduction to Civil Engineering, ECIV 201: Computational Methods for Civil Engineering) Pierce’s proposal aims to develop and implement the foundation for a programmatic Integrative Learning Plan (ILP) within the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering (CEE) focusing primarily on the first two years of the curriculum. The goal of this proposal is to create a structured curricular approach for raising student awareness about purposeful involvement and integrative learning. The two proposed ILP courses are distinctly different from one another in terms of instructional content and delivery, making them good candidates for introducing integrative learning from two different perspectives. The plan will elevate and, hopefully, institutionalize student awareness of the GLD program. However, even if students choose not to pursue GLD or do not meet the GPA requirements, the ILP will expose all students to the value of pursuing meaningful extracurricular activities and reflecting on how these experiences are connected to their academic learning. Charles Pierce Susan Rathbun-Grubb, Assistant Professor, School of Library and Information Science (SLIS 735: Metadata, SUS 732: Indexing and Abstracting) SUS735- Metadata and SUS 732- lndexing and Abstracting require students to plan and design digital collections and to create and use taxonomies for information. While the courses assess the students\' ability to plan for a system, the instructor was unable to adequately demonstrate, teach, or assess skills related to implementation and testing of the planned systems. A 16-month subscription to the Microsoft SharePoint content management system will allow the instructor to bridge the theory-practice divide by enabling students to practice implementation skills and to evaluate usability. Moreover, the system will enable students to make the vital connection between metadata design ""best practices"" and the demonstrable evidence of a real system that can be utilized and tested. The addition of a reflective portion to the assignments will also give students the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of their design decisions in a system they are very likely to encounter when they join the workforce as a professional. Susan Rathbun-Grubb Armen Shaomian, Assistant Professor, Department of Sport and Entertainment Management (SPTE 590: The Business of Broadway) This entirely new course designed to explore and understand the multibillion-dollar Broadway industry will focus on knowledge and skills that will assist students in promoting positive change in professional settings. As an integral part of the live-entertainment industry, this course will fill a large gap in the entertainment management portion of the Sport and Entertainment Management degree, not only by increasing students\' knowledge and awareness of the business and management aspects of Broadway, but also channeling them into entertainment management careers through the benefit of their high-level of management expertise accrued in specific relation to this course. Shaomian intends for this course to be an exciting and new course option, using integrative learning methods for management students engaged in the USC Connect Graduation with Leadership Distinction (GLD) program. Students will be provided with unique insights into the creative and artistic world that translate across all managerial disciplines by including several peer leadership opportunities throughout the course. Armen Shaomian David Weintraub, Senior Instructor, School of Journalism and Mass Communications (JOUR 499-001: Freelancing for Creative Professionals) Weintraub’s project will retool the existing special-topics course, Freelancing for Creative Professionals, into an elective course with a permanent place in the curriculum. The course examines the theory and practice of entrepreneurship as they apply to creative professionals. Students learn the skills and techniques necessary for starting and operating their own successful freelance business. An important component of the course is integrative learning, in this case exposing students to professionals working in creative fields through interviews with local entrepreneurs; sales pitches to actual clients; business proposals to clients or investors; guest speakers in the classroom, field visits to business run by local entrepreneurs, and Skype interviews with leading experts. The goal of this project is to retool both the course content and the instructional methods to provide students with an enriched integrative-learning experience.

It combines various aspects of learning, allowing students to connect their experiences with their academic learning. These courses often encourage reflection on the connection between experiences and academic study, helping students apply what they've learned to solve problems and make decisions.

For instance, at the University of South Carolina (USC), there are several integrative courses such as ECIV 101: Introduction to Civil Engineering, ECIV 201: Computational Methods for Civil Engineering, SLIS 735: Metadata, SUS 732: Indexing and Abstracting, SPTE 590: The Business of Broadway, JOUR 499-001: Freelancing for Creative Professionals, and JOUR 499-002: Entrepreneurship for Creative Professionals.","An Integrative course is a course in the major,in which selected Carolina Core learning outcomes are integrated into the chosen major. Each undergraduate program must have an approved integrative course and require it as part of the major to ensure that all undergraduate students have had an integrative course in their major. It cannot just be an option in the major. Learn more on integrative courses .

What is Navigate? EAB Navigate is one of the four advising technologies used on the USC Columbia campus. It is heavily utilized as the primary scheduling platform for academic advising appointments, as well as for nearly two dozen student service offices around campus. The original platform is intended to guide the prioritization of outreach to and interaction with students based on risk levels and success marker flags. The success markers are established by each department based on the courses that are most predictive of success in each major over time using USC historic student data, or based on critical courses from major maps. These involve both threshold grades in key courses and the timing of those courses. Risk levels are based on student performance and characteristics relative to other students who have graduated in the particular major. Success markers, risk levels, and student characteristics (GPA ranges, class level, department, college, native/transfer, etc.) can be used to quickly query lists of students who may need further assistance. EAB Navigate for Scheduling - Academic Units The list below includes all colleges, departments, and advising units currently utilizing EAB Navigate for scheduling their appointments with students.

In addition, all students in the school are subject to the regulations on probation, suspension, and readmission in the “Academic Standards” section of the “Academic Regulations” chapter of this bulletin. At the end of the sophomore year, each student’s progress toward completion of lower-division requirements will be evaluated. Upper Division To be admitted to the upper division, students must meet the following criteria: completion of piano proficiency requirements; completion of the Aural Skills training sequence MUSC 117 , MUSC 118 , MUSC 217 , MUSC 218 ); Bachelor of Music with an emphasis in Theory majors must achieve a minimum grade of “ B ” completion of music theory sequence ( MUSC 115 , MUSC 215 ); Bachelor of Music with an emphasis in Theory majors must achieve a minimum grade of “ B ” for music education majors, completion of the Music Education Practicum ( MUED 200 ); for Bachelor of Music students, approval of the applied jury to progress to the upper-division courses (MUSC 311 or MUSC 411), as appropriate to the chosen degree program; completion of at least 60 credits with a cumulative grade point average of 2.50 in MUSC and MUED courses and 2.00 in all courses.

For further information on this and other University regulations, see the “Academic Regulations” chapter of this bulletin. Advisement Every music major will be assigned an advisor in the school, who will consult with the student throughout the college career. Students must see their academic advisors at least once each semester for assistance in planning their academic program. No student will be allowed to complete the registration process without an advisement form approved by an assigned faculty advisor. It is the responsibility of each student to understand and complete all degree requirements. The student’s major advisor is responsible for interpreting and applying major, minor, and cognate requirements. When special problems arise, the student may consult the director of undergraduate studies. Right of Petition A student may seek relief from academic standards and regulations by appealing to the Scholastic Standards and Petitions Committee of the School of Music. Information on procedures may be obtained from the music studies office. Career Development The School of Music aims to complement academic advising by assisting music students in clarifying career directions. Students are encouraged to begin the process of career planning as early as possible. Career counselors are available in the University Career Center to assist students in gaining an understanding of their own interests, values, abilities, and personalities, the nature of a liberal arts education and the related marketable skills, and the numerous career opportunities available for music majors. In addition, students are encouraged to complement their academic studies with career-related work experience such as internships, cooperative education, part-time work experience, or volunteer work. Special Opportunities Performance Certificate The performance certificate is awarded by the School of Music to recognize those undergraduate music students with degree emphases other than music performance as well as those students not majoring in music. The performance certificate will allow gifted and highly motivated students to acquire additional credit, professorial interaction and guidance, and departmental distinction in music performance. Incoming freshman may demonstrate their fitness for the performance certificate during their qualifying or scholarship audition. Continuing students are eligible to enter this program by application to the coordinator of the appropriate area faculty and upon recommendation of the area faculty jury.

Carolina Core The Carolina Core(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/) is a set of requirements that students across the University of South Carolina have to complete as part of their program of study. The Carolina Core is made up of 10 core components, each with a learning outcome and credit hour requirements. Click below on each requirement to learn more. You can find the entire list of Carolina Core applicable courses, as well as the requirements that they fulfill in the most recent academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/carolina-core-courses/#foundationalcoursestext) . College Requirements The College Requirements are different from the Carolina Core, in that they are only required for the specific college in which you are studying. While looking at the separate components of the Carolina Core above, you may have noticed that there is some overlap between Carolina Core and College Requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences. Click on each College Requirement below to learn more. For more information on the College Requirements, follow the link to the College of Arts and Sciences College Requirements on the academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/arts-sciences/#text) . Expand all Additional Humanities Every student within the College of Arts and Sciences is required to take at least one additional Humanities class. Students who are pursuing a BS are only required to take 3 hours of additional Humanities, while students who are pursuing a BA are required to take 9 hours of Additional Humanities (3 classes). Please see your advisor for a list of applicable courses. Founding Documents The Founding Documents requirement is required for students who entered USC in Fall 2021 or later. There are seven courses that can apply go towards this requirement, and they focus on America’s Founding Documents and works about African American’s struggles for freedom. Learn more about the Founding Documents requirement(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/internal/undergrad_students/founding_documents.php) . Expand all Tip: Have you taken HIST 111 to satisfy one of your GHS requirements? If so, HIST 111 will also count towards the Founding Documents requirement! The Founding Documents requirement is the only other place in your program of study besides the overlay, where one course can fulfill two requirements. Talk to your advisor about how to make the most out of the classes you take! Foreign Language As stated in the GFL section of the Carolina Core, as a CAS student, you will need to reach the 122 level of foreign language of your choice. How many hours of foreign language you will have to take is dependent on your Foreign Language Placement Test(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) score. You must register in advance to take this Placement test. Once you have your score, your advisor will help you register(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) for the appropriate foreign language class. Social Science As part of the CAS College Requirements, you will need one GSS Carolina Core and an additional Social Sciences class. While any of the GSS courses can apply towards this requirement, you can always ask your advisor for a list of applicable courses. U.S. History/Non-U.S. History The College of Arts and Sciences requires you to take both a US History class, as well as a Non-U.S. History class. One will count towards your Carolina Core GHS requirement and the second will apply towards your GHS College Requirement.

For a new course submitted in APPS, complete the Carolina Core information. If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, a course change proposal must be submitted in APPS with the Carolina Core information completed. Integrative Course Proposals An Integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. As a result, regulatory oversight is ceded predominantly to the academic unit. A department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporates one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes such that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course. The following is the process to designate or delete an Integrative course. Add an Integrative Course Submit a new course proposal or course change proposal as appropriate in APPS. In the justification section, provide the following information: Carolina Core Integrative Course, Major Name, Degree (e.g., ANTH 444, Anthropology, B.S.) and explain which Carolina Core Learning outcomes(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/faculty-and-staff/learning-outcomes.php) are met by the course and how the course meets the Carolina Core Learning outcome(s). No syllabus is required. Delete an Integrative Course For deletions of only the Integrative Course designation (not the whole course), submit a course change proposal in APPS and state in the justification that the Integrative Course designation is being deleted. Upon Approval in Faculty Senate, the Integrative Course will be scribed into Degree Works. The Office of Academic Programs will also report the information to the Office of the Provost to ensure that the Carolina Core website is updated and the records in the Office of the Provost are updated.']","The process for course actions involves creating, revising, or eliminating graduate and undergraduate courses at the University of South Carolina.

The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. As a result, regulatory oversight is ceded predominantly to the academic unit. A department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporates one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes such that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course. The following is the process to designate or delete an Integrative course. Add an Integrative Course Submit a new course proposal or course change proposal as appropriate in APPS. In the justification section, provide the following information: Carolina Core Integrative Course, Major Name, Degree (e.g., ANTH 444, Anthropology, B.S.) and explain which Carolina Core Learning outcomes(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/faculty-and-staff/learning-outcomes.php) are met by the course and how the course meets the Carolina Core Learning outcome(s). No syllabus is required. Delete an Integrative Course For deletions of only the Integrative Course designation (not the whole course), submit a course change proposal in APPS and state in the justification that the Integrative Course designation is being deleted. Upon Approval in Faculty Senate, the Integrative Course will be scribed into Degree Works. The Office of Academic Programs will also report the information to the Office of the Provost to ensure that the Carolina Core website is updated and the records in the Office of the Provost are updated.']","Program actions involve various steps to approve new programs, program modifications, and certificates at the University of South Carolina. Here is the process for each:

1. New Program:
   - Propose a new program using the New Program Proposal Form and submit it to the Office of Academic Programs before the deadline.
   - The proposal goes through several levels of approval, including the College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses, Faculty Senate, and the Board of Trustees Academic Excellence Committee (BOT AESEC).
   - Once approved by BOT AESEC, the proposal is discussed by the full Board of Trustees.
   - After approval from the Board of Trustees, the program appears in the next Bulletin.

2. Program Modification:
   - Propose a program modification using the Program Modification Proposal Form and submit it to the Office of Academic Programs before the deadline.
   - The proposal goes through several levels of approval, including the College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses, Faculty Senate, and the Board of Trustees Academic Excellence Committee (BOT AESEC).
   - Once approved by BOT AESEC, the proposal is discussed by the full Board of Trustees.
   - After approval from the Board of Trustees, the modified program appears in the next Bulletin.

3. New Certificate:
   - Similar to new programs, propose a new certificate using the New Program Proposal Form and submit it to the Office of Academic Programs before the deadline.
   - The proposal goes through several levels of approval, including the College/School Representative, Curricula and Courses, Faculty Senate, and the Board of Trustees Academic Excellence Committee (BOT AESEC).
   - Once approved by BOT AESEC, the proposal is discussed by the full Board of Trustees.
   - After approval from the Board of Trustees, the certificate appears in the next Bulletin.

The timeline for these actions varies but typically follows the shortest possible time to process a proposal through the approval cycle. If deadlines are not met, the proposal will rotate into the next subsequent cycle.",Internal Approvals: Academic Unit Head (Chair) Academic Unit Heads for departments affected by the action (only if needed) College/School Representative (usually the APL) Undergraduate Dean Registrar (Banner Validation and Degree Audit) Curricula and Courses Committee Faculty Senate External Approvals: 8. Board of Trustees (if needed) 9. CHE (if needed) 10. SACSCOC notification and/or substantive change (if needed) See the APPS Approval Flow Chart for program actions.

18,"When do cross-listed courses require additional proposals,and not just letters of concurrence?","['Have corresponding program changes been submitted? Do the pre-/co-requisite changes involve another department/program? If so, has a letter of concurrence been submitted? Variable Credit Hours? If the course hours are variable: Are maximum and minimum credit hours specified? Is a grading scale and assignments for each credit hour provided? For example, if the course is offered for 1-3 credits, a grading scale and assignments must be provided for 1 credit, 2 credits, and 3 credits. Is the number of times this course may be taken for credit greater than 1? (The statement is asking how many times it can be counted on the transcript as part of the program of study--not whether it can be repeated if failed. Only special topics courses or possibly internships should have a number greater than 1. Is this one of those?) Course Proposals Requiring Syllabi New courses (including new cross-lists) and courses that involves a significant change in course description, a change in Carolina Core or GLD designation, or a change in delivery mode to >50% online require a file syllabus. The following checklist items apply. Designator, Title, Course Info Does the course title in the proposal match that in the syllabus? Does the syllabus indicate the instructors\' name as well as course meting days, times, and location (or equivalent)? Does the bulletin description in the proposal match that in the syllabus? Pre- or Co-requisites Are the pre/co-requisites included in the syllabus and do they match those in/proposed for the bulletin? Special Topics and Independent Studies These course are often variable credit and can be taken multiple times. The proposal should include the range of hours, number of times the course can be taken for credit and the maximum number of credit hours that can be applied to the degree. The Number of times the course can be taken for credit is not how many attempts a student can have to pass the course, but is how many times it can be taken, usually under different topics or studies. Example: Credit hours minimum for a single offering is 1. Credit hours maximum for a single offering is 6. Number of times the course can be taken is 6. Number of credit hours if course can be taken multiple times is 12. Is this all correct in the proposal? Learning Outcomes Does the syllabus include ""Learning Outcomes"" and use that exact phrase (as opposed to ""Learning Objectives"" etc.)? Do the Learning Outcome describe significant and essential learning that students will achieve and can reliably demonstrate at the end of a course, e.g., ""By the end of the course, students will: ....""? Do the statements follow best-practices, particularly with respect to action verbs that identify quantifiable or measurable actions? See https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/coursedevelopment/learning_outcomes/(https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/course_design_development_delivery/learning_outcomes/index.php) and www.apu.edu/live_data/files/333/blooms_taxonomy_action_verbs.pdf(http://www.apu.edu/live_data/files/333/blooms_taxonomy_action_verbs.pdf) If this is a 500/600 level course is there at least one learning outcome specific to graduate students? This should connect to an assignment specific to graduate students. Caroline Core Course? If this is a Carolina Core Course: Does the proposal specify one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core? If this is proposed as an overlay course, does it include at least one learning outcome from CMS, INF, or VSR? Is the offering colleges/department expert in the content pertaining to the learning outcome? If course content potentially overlaps with content offered by another program, has a letter of concurrence been provided? Policy Statements Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding academic integrity? Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding attendance policy? Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding students with disabilities? Evaluation Does this syllabus specify assignments, projects, quizzes, and/or exams with brief descriptions of expectations and points/weights assigned to each activity? Does the syllabus clearly indicate the grading scale, weight of each assignment (points or percentage), and how grades will be assigned? If standard grades are used, does the syllabus indicate how letters A-F will be assigned (by points or percentage)?']","When creating cross-listed courses, both departments involved need to submit corresponding program changes. Letters of concurrence are only required if the pre-/co-requisites involve another department or program. Cross-listed courses do not necessarily require additional proposals, but they do need to meet all the usual requirements for course proposals, such as having matching titles, descriptions, pre-/co-requisites, and learning outcomes in both departments' bulletins.","Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Anytime a course is being deleted. If multiple cross-listed courses are being deleted,separate proposals are needed. Anytime a new course is being created. If a new course is to be cross listed with another new course,two proposals are needed (one for each course). If a new course is going to be cross listed with an existing course,only one proposal is needed. The proposal that creates the new course can also create the cross list,but does need a letter of concurrency.

19,When is a syllabus required for a proposal?,"['), the initiator creates a syllabus in compliance with university syllabus guidelines and completes the necessary CIC forms for processing. The iSchool Curriculum Committee reviews the proposal and presents a recommendation to the entire faculty at the next scheduled faculty meeting. Special faculty meetings (in person or virtual) may be called for the purpose of an expedited vote when university due dates are incompatible with regularly scheduled Faculty Meetings. Faculty may approve the proposal in which case it will move forward to the appropriate Faculty Senate (undergraduate) or Graduate Council (graduate) committee. Faculty may also disapprove the proposal and refer it back to the initiator for revision. Proposal Components All proposals require a completed syllabus aligning with InDev requirements and all other university policy items (learning outcomes, required textbook, student support, disability, academic integrity, etc.) If the proposal is for a new permanent course, please contact the Chair of the Curriculum Committee for an appropriate new course number. Changes to courses must take into consideration any prerequisites/corequisites/cross listings, and other requirements of the course undergoing revision. Once the Curriculum Committee approves the proposal packet, the proposal will be forwarded for iSchool faculty approval. After the iSchool faculty approves the proposal, the proposal will be forwarded to the CIC Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for submission via the U of SC App system.

By understanding how DegreeWorks functions, faculty can better assist students in choosing the most appropriate courses to fulfill degree requirements and ensure that all degree applicable credit is applied correctly. Furthermore, faculty can use DegreeWorks to run ""what if"" and ""look ahead"" scenarios for students who are considering changing majors or degrees. Overall, DegreeWorks serves as a valuable resource for staying informed about students' academic progress and providing guidance throughout their college journey.","Every undergraduate student has access to his/her personal degree audit. This in important because students monitor their own progress. Degree audits are especially important for athletes,veterans,and OSP (Opportunity Scholars Program) students,who must have an accurate degree audit for compliance (NCAA,GI Bill,Federal Funding). Faculty need to be aware of this because curricular decisions must be accurately reflected in DegreeWorks.",0.5
24,Will my proposal require any external approvals?,"['If another university is lead, you must submit a budget, scope of work, etc., to USCeRA for approval. USC will be listed as a subaward and receive a contract if awarded. You can’t receive direct compensation from an external source for work related to your position/research at USC unless you receive prior approval. ALL EXTERNAL PROPOSALS MUST GO THROUGH USCeRA. Only SAM can submit proposals. Also, faculty must report outside activities and financial interests yearly, so disclosures alert for potential conflicts. Note USC’s Outside Professional Activities for Faculty Policy # ACAF 1.50 before entering into any agreement. If you have questions regarding that policy, please see Rachel Rolli. If you have other questions related to specific grants and USCeRA, please ask Terri. She is our liaison to SAM. What if I do not have time to submit through USCeRA? There are very rare occasions when SAM will permit the PI to submit to the sponsor as long as the proposal has been reviewed by Terri, the Dean, and the Director. There is no guarantee this will be permitted by SAM. SAM requires a minimum of three business days for review and submission. If there is a potential problem meeting the deadline, Terri will alert SAM for guidance. I am listed as a co-PI on a grant. How do I get recognition and associated IDC for my portion of the award? SAM can create separate accounts to distribute funds awarded outside our college and schools. If you are included in a sponsored project with another department, the lead PI should request a separate subaccount when submitting the proposal to USCeRA. If awarded, a subaccount will be created with your budget, IDC, and revenue (if any). We recommend subaccounts for all awards now. If you are collaborating with another university or entity outside USC, please ask to be listed as a subrecipient. How are faculty compensated for work on a grant? Depending on sponsor guidelines, faculty can choose summer compensation and/or a course buyout. The buyout rate is 12.5% of faculty salary + fringe + health. Buyouts must be approved by the school director and the dean (typically one course buyout per year is allowed, or two in rare exceptions). Who do I go to if I have questions about the grant process? Terri should be your first contact if/when you are working on a grant. Terri will work closely with SAM. If you would like assistance in reviewing the content of your grant proposal (the idea, the writing, etc.), please reach out to the Associate Dean of Research. Time permitting, Linwan will be happy to review proposals and/or she might be able to solicit feedback from the school directors and/or other experts in your area of research. Where can I go to search for grant opportunities? Terri routinely searches for funding opportunities for the college. Faculty are also encouraged to search for funding. Two external and two internal sites for funding are listed below: Federal grants(https://www.grants.gov/) Pivot(https://pivot.proquest.com/) (Offers the ability to sign up for email alerts) Internal Funding and Awards USC internal grants What is the difference between direct and indirect costs? Get detailed information on direct and indirect costs here What if I have an idea for research or other programming or scholarship that would require funding, but would need collaborators or other help? Please notify Terri(https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/cic/faculty-staff/moorer_terri.php) and Linwan(https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/cic/faculty-staff/wu_linwan.php) about your idea. They can help you search for possible grant funders and/or help you find collaborators who might be able to help pursue your goals. I received an award. What are my duties as PI? It varies by grant, but typically the Principal Investigator: Is responsible for all actions required to manage and complete the scientific and programmatic aspects of the sponsored project. Initiates the hiring or assignment process and approves the selection or appointment of individuals to the project and is responsible for communicating staff changes to departmental administrative staff. Ensures the integrity and safeguarding of data. Ensures the completion, accuracy and timeliness of reports.

If you answer YES to any of the following, it needs approval through USCeRA. Is this an institutional grant? Does it require a budget? Does it need a University of South Carolina (USC) Authorized Signature? When is my proposal due in USCeRA and the submission software? Arnold School of Public Health (ASPH) requires completed proposals to be entered in USCeRA and the submission software of your choice 7 business days before the sponsor’s or submitting institution’s deadline. Example: If your proposal is due to the sponsor on Friday at 5 p.m., you must submit a completed, ready-to-review proposal to USC by 5 p.m. on Wednesday the week before. What is due to the Office of Research (OoR) 7 business days before the sponsor deadline? To comply, a completed proposal must be loaded in USCeRA, and the submission software must be ready for review. A PI may still tweak the Aims and Research Strategy sections during review, but all other areas of the proposal must be complete. Can I work on my research strategy and aims pages during the 7-day review? Yes, you can continue working on these up until submission. I am collaborating with another institution, and I am the PI (USC is the primary submitter) on the project. What steps and forms/files does the institution need to provide in USCeRA? In USCeRA, while completing the PAP (Proposal/Award Processing form), answer the collaboration questions under the “Funding” section. Then, under the “Questions” section (last section), click yes to question number 5 (Sole source considerations: subcontracts, outside consultants, equipment?) and complete the sole source certification that will pop up under “My Forms” after the PAP form is completed. NOTE: complete ONE certification for EACH collaborating institution (i.e., 3 collaborating institutions = 3 certification forms). Click the “Add Certification” button under the tools section for additional certifications. Upload the following forms for each subaward: Please ask subawards to return paperwork 1 week before the USCeRA deadline. CSOW (scope of work) Budget Budget justification Letter of intent/collaboration approved by the SAM (Sponsored Awards Management) equivalent representative for the institution USC Subrecipient commitment form Additional information for NIH (National Institutes of Health) submissions: Facilities document Biosketches Equipment, if applicable Performance site LOI (Letter of Intent) from PI (per solicitation) LOI from consultant (per application) that reflects SOW, the time frame, and the fee When is my proposal due in USCeRA if I am a subcontract to another institution? Your proposal is due in USCeRA 7 business days before the institution has requested your paperwork. Please use the prime institution’s deadline in USCeRA instead of the main sponsor’s deadline. I am collaborating with another institution, and I am the co-I or co-PI (USC is a subaward) on the project. What forms/files do I need to upload in USCeRA? Scope of work (a description of USC’s portion of work in the project; be specific). Budget and budget justification (ask the collaborator if the institution requires specific forms). Any other required forms from the collaborating institution. SAM representative will write the letter of intent/collaboration. In the comment section, add contact information and how the documents are being submitted once approved. Can I change my budget after it goes through USCeRA? You can change the budget, but it will then have to be routed again for signatures. All documents must be in final form in USCeRA and for the submission application at the time of routing for approvals. Rerouting a proposal with revisions not requested by ASPH OoR or SAM resets the 7-business-day deadline. Do I need a waiver in USCeRA if I am using a different IDC (Indirect Cost) rate than the current rates above? Yes.', 'USCeRA FAQs for PIs and Unit Approvers - My Arts and Sciences | University of South Carolina Skip to Content My Arts and Sciences SC.edu Study Colleges and Schools My Arts and Sciences For Faculty and Staff Administration and Departments Grants Operations USCeRA FAQs for PIs and Unit Approvers USCeRA FAQs for PIs and Unit Approvers USCeRA is the university’s electronic research administration system. Faculty create and submit proposals through USCeRA to get unit head’s and dean’s office approval of proposal submissions prior to review by the Sponsored Awards Management (SAM) office. SAM office approval is required for all proposals. For general user instructions, please visit the SAM’s user guide(http://sam.research.sc.edu/pdf/USCERA_Userguide.pdf) . PDF version of FAQs [pdf] FAQs for CAS Proposal Principal Investigators (PIs) 1. When should I create a new proposal in USCeRA? As soon as you know you’ll be submitting an external proposal, you can create and save a new proposal in USCeRA. The approval process should be complete at least three days before the sponsor’s due date. This allows a couple of business days for your unit head and dean’s office to review – if they have questions, they may send the proposal back to you for corrections. We recommend submitting in USCERA as early as possible. A member of the CAS Grants team can help you complete the USCERA forms – email casgrant@mailbox.sc.edu for assistance. 2. What attachments are required for a USCeRA proposal to be considered ready for submission into the approval stage? At a minimum, you need to attach 1) a budget; 2) budget justification; and 3) project summary or abstract. If you have a subaward, you need to attach their budget, budget justification, statement of work, institutional letter of commitment, and subrecipient commitment form (new SAM requirement, template here). You should consider allowing some extra review time when your project involves subawards – if you or a member of the CAS Grants team identifies issues with the information submitted, this will allow time to work with the subawardee to make revisions before USCERA submission. If your proposal requires additional forms/templates that your SAM representative will need to review or sign in advance of submission, also attach those here (e.g. a sponsor-specific financial questionnaire). 3. I am submitting a Letter of Intent, not a full proposal – do I need to submit a proposal in USCeRA? Generally, letters of intent don’t require a budget component, so a USCERA submission isn’t required. Contact your SAM representative if you’re unsure. 4. In the USCERA form titled Personnel and Effort Expended on the Project, what should I include? Enter the effort in months (or percentages) for key personnel for the first year of the project. The salary entry should match the amount requested for the corresponding person for the first year of the project. 5. I am applying for a Fellowship for faculty – if selected, the fellowship will be paid directly to me – do I need to submit a proposal in USCeRA? Yes. Fellowship applications often raise numerous issues; in particular, when the fellowship requires the applicant to spend time away from campus. Issues, including salary, benefits, and teaching relief, often come up and need to be addressed before work on the fellowship proposal is started. It is strongly advised that you have a discussion with your department chair/school director and the associate dean for research when considering a fellowship application. Fellowships that require the faculty member to teach at another institution will not be supported by the college. 6. The fellowship I’m applying for is for a fixed amount, do I still need to include a budget in USCERA? Yes. The level of support provided by a particular fellowship is often set by the funding agency, but a budget and budget justification must still be uploaded in USCERA. The budget may be short and simply state that the amount requested is set by the funding agency. The budget justification should address how this money will be used – for salary, for travel, for course buyouts, etc. Any potential co-funding from the department or college should have been discussed prior to submission in USCERA as well as indicated in the comments section of Proposal/Award Processing form. 7. How do I know what indirect cost rate to apply?']","Based on the provided context, if your proposal is an institutional grant requiring a budget and a University of South Carolina (USC) authorized signature, it will need approval through USCeRA. However, the context does not specify whether external approvals are necessary. If you're unsure, we recommend checking with your Sponsored Awards Management (SAM) representative or the sponsor for clarification.","Only programs require external approvals (the President,Board of Trustees (BoT),SACS,and CHE notification or approval),as outline in ACAF 2.00: ""All new academic programs and program name changes across the entire USC system must be approved by the president. All new academic programs and program name changes across the entire USC system must be approved by the University Board of Trustees."" CHE approval is required in the following cases: New degree programs; New academic certificates of any length in a new CIP code; New academic certificates of more than 18 credit hours in a current CIP code; Program revisions of more than 18 credit hours including the addition of one or more program concentrations and CIP code changes; Program revisions of delivery location to off-campus (50% or more of credit hours); Extension of an approved health professions program to additional sites in-state,and Center and institute proposals requesting new or additional state funding.

27,How do I know when my finals are?,"[""Finals Tips: How to ace your finals - USC News & Events | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Finals Tips: How to ace your finals Posted on: November 24, 2021; Updated on: November 24, 2021 By Cam Adams, stucomm@mailbox.sc.edu With finals just around the corner, you may be feeling a bit stressed. Lauren Brown of the Student Success Center has helped us put together a list of tips to guide you through the most stressful time of the year. Come up with a study plan Before hitting the books, you need to know what to expect for the exam. When and where are your exams? Are your exams cumulative or do they cover the last few weeks? What is the format of your exam? Knowing this information can help you determine how you need to study for each exam and when you need to start studying for each exam. It’s recommended that students spread their studying out seven days before their exam. Brown also advises that students break their studying up into “chunks” within that week. For each chunk, determine what you want to cover, what your study strategy will be and the amount of time you’ll need. Once you get to the day before the exam, you should do a general review of the material with a focus on your weakest areas. Lastly, study smarter, not harder. Once you get back from Thanksgiving break, you should start to implement your study plan. Use campus resources Another way to study effectively for finals is to make use of campus resources. The Student Success Center can be your go-to for all of your finals needs. In partnership with Russell House, the center will be hosting over 50 two-hour finals review sessions starting Dec. 4 and running through the remainder of finals week. Students can also drop into Russell House for tutoring between Dec. 1 and 4, and schedule one-on-one appointments on the Mezzanine level of the Thomas Cooper Library beginning Dec. 6. More info on these resources can be found on the student success center website . Remember to take care of yourself Although finals week is a very important time of the semester, it’s also important to take care of yourself and prioritize your mental health. Remember to take periodic breaks throughout your study time as it allows your mind to reset. It is also important to remember to get a good night’s sleep, giving your brain the rest it needs to ace your finals. Share this Story!

It is part of our campus license that includes Office Pro Plus and Office online like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. How to Video »(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZwmxUgSfZM) Why should I use OneDrive for Business instead of a different cloud document storage product such as DropBox or Google Docs? OneDrive for Business is covered by a Business Associates Agreement (BAA) and ensures the data is only stored in the continental United States as well as encrypted in transit and while stored. In other words, you can store FERPA, HIPAA and other forms of documents with PII data there safely. UTS centrally supports OneDrive for Business for cloud file storage and collaboration. What is the difference between OneDrive for Business and OneDrive? \u200b\u200bOneDrive for Business is administered by University Technology Services, and it’s usage is covered under our enterprise license with Microsoft for faculty, staff and students. OneDrive is a consumer service provided and administered by Microsoft and is not covered under any contracts with USC. Faculty, staff, and students should use OneDrive for Business accessible through Office 365 for USC related documents. If you have a personal OneDrive account, it cannot be merged with your OneDrive for Business account, but you can still use both separately. Note: Personal OneDrive is not covered under our BAA, is not encrypted and has less storage. How can I use OneDrive for Business to collaborate? Create, upload, and share documents and folders with your colleagues and allow them to view, edit those documents or create new documents. You can also edit them at the same time in the web browser by using the online office products. OneDrive for Business will scan each document before uploading it to verify that it is not a known virus or malware distributor. Our current storage limits are set at 5 TB per user. OneDrive for Business is a recommended solution that has been vetted and security hardened for the protection of university data. However, the use of OneDrive for Business is not mandatory for university students, faculty, or staff. Is data stored in OneDrive for Business backed up? Microsoft periodically backs up data stored in OneDrive for Business for disaster recovery purposes only.

Qualified students can take courses that count toward both undergraduate and graduate degrees, reducing the time and cost to earn the graduate degree. How does it work? Qualified undergraduate students can earn up to 12 credit hours of graduate-level classes while still an undergraduate through the Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan. Here's how it works: Classes must be 500-level and above Classes must be taken for graduate credit through the application process described below Classes can be applied to your baccalaureate program and, with graduate program admission and approval, applied to your graduate program of study The use of dual credit can reduce the total time to earn both the undergraduate and graduate degrees. You can also use your undergraduate financial aid to pay for the dual credit courses. What graduate programs are available? While our five-year bachelor’s/master’s programs of study are popular, all of our graduate certificates, master’s degrees and Ph.D. programs are eligible for inclusion in an Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan. For specifics on our offerings, visit our Graduate Programs page. Who is eligible? You will need to have earned at least 90 hours of undergraduate coursework and have a minimum GPA of 3.4 to formally apply for this program. However, we encourage engineering and computing students to start planning, with your advisor’s help, before your junior year. Note that you don’t need to be pursuing an undergraduate degree from the Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing to start in one of our accelerated graduate programs. Of course, classes taken for dual credit must be degree-applicable for both your undergraduate degree and your intended graduate program of study. When both are in the same or similar discipline, it is easy to earn up to 12 hours of dual credit. We want you to be able to earn as much dual credit as possible, so please discuss the Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan with your advisor prior to taking your engineering, computing and technical electives and other 500-level classes that may be available for dual credit. You need to initially register for such classes for graduate credit for them to count, as graduate credit cannot be awarded retroactively. How do I apply? You will need to submit an initial application before registering for your first class in this program, and then again prior to each semester that you want to earn dual credit for a class. It is not complicated. Just follow the instructions on the Accelerated Bachelor’s/Graduate Study Plan (G-ABGSP) form in the Graduate School’s Forms Library(https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/graduate_school/graduate-studies/forms_library/index.php) .

Honors classes go in depth to help students become more knowledgeable in their discipline, or pursue new topics they had not considered before. Small class sizes foster relationships with faculty who may turn into life-long mentors. Opportunities such as internships, research and service learning provide opportunities to apply your curriculum in hands-on settings, allowing you to prepare you for your future career and distinguish yourself as you pursue jobs or further education. Between our 36+ professional staff members and our Honors alumni network of over 10,000 graduates, you’ll have a great support system in the Honors College! Will I receive honors credit for my AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses? Most of our students earn college credit before graduating from high school. Credits earned via AP/IB/Cambridge tests or dual-enrollment are not counted toward honors requirements, but they do count towards the Carolina Core, as appropriate(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/undergraduate_admissions/requirements/for_freshmen/ap_ib_credits/) . These credits often serve as pre-requisites for upper-level courses and can allow room in your course of study for higher-level courses. You can discuss your options with your advisor. Why don\'t you accept AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses for Honors? The premise of an AP/IB or dual-enrollment course is that it is equivalent to a college course. They are not designed as Honors College courses. This is a common practice amongst honors colleges and programs across the country. How do students apply their AP/IB or dual-enrollment courses as Honors students? There are many ways! These credits often apply towards Carolina Core requirements, allowing students more flexibility in their schedule to take exploratory seminar classes. It is not uncommon for Honors students to double major or add a minor with room in their schedule due to credits earned in high school. Students may also choose to shorten their time in undergraduate studies by graduating early or taking graduate level coursework as a senior. Given the rigor of the Honors requirements, however, we do not generally see students graduate with honors in two or fewer years. All of these options can be tailored to your needs and discussed in-depth with your advisor. How are Honors students involved at USC? It is up to each student how much they want to get involved, but Honors students tend to do a lot outside the classroom, holding nearly 30% of leadership positions on campus, despite being about 8% of the undergraduate population. They are involved in band, Greek life, athletics, student government, community service and much more!

The ADA prohibits discrimination in all employment practices, including job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. It applies to recruitment, advertising, tenure, layoff, leave, fringe benefits, and all other employment-related activities. If you have questions or concerns regarding an accommodation that has or has not been provided to you, please contact the Employee Relations Office by emailing uscer@mailbox.sc.edu or calling 803-777-3821. If you feel that you have been subjected to unlawful discrimination or harassment related to a disability, please contact the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (by calling 803-777-3854 or emailing eop@mailbox.sc.edu . You may also file a complaint online(https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofSouthCarolinaEOP&layout_id=40.) . Who is protected against employment discrimination by the ADA, as amended? Employment discrimination is prohibited against ""qualified individuals with disabilities."" Persons discriminated against because they have a known association or relationship with a disabled individual are also protected. The ADA defines an ""individual with a disability"" as a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities or bodily functions, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. The first part of the definition makes clear that the ADA applies to persons who have substantial, as distinct from minor impairments, and that these must be impairments that limit major life activities or bodily functions.', 'The decision as to the appropriate accommodation for a specific individual must be based on the facts of each case. In selecting the reasonable accommodation to be provided, the principal test is that of effectiveness, i.e., whether the accommodation will enable the person with a disability to do the job in question. Must employers be familiar with the many diverse types of disabilities to know whether or how to make a reasonable accommodation? No. An employer is required to accommodate only a ""known"" disability of a qualified applicant or employee. The requirement generally will be triggered by a request from an individual with a disability, who frequently can suggest an appropriate accommodation. Accommodations must be made on an individual basis because the nature and extent of a disabling condition and the requirements of the job will vary in each case. If the individual does not request an accommodation, the employer is not obligated to provide one. If a disabled person requests, but cannot suggest, an appropriate accommodation, the employer and the individual should work together through an interactive process to identify one. There are also many public and private resources that can provide assistance without cost. Contact the Employee Relations Office at uscer@mailbox.sc.edu or 803-777-3821 for more information. What are the limitations on the obligation to make a reasonable accommodation? The disabled individual requiring the accommodation must be otherwise qualified, and the disability must be known to the employer. In addition, an employer is not required to make an accommodation if it would impose an ""undue hardship"" on the operation of the employer\'s business. ""Undue hardship"" is defined as ""an action requiring significant difficulty or expense"" when considered in light of a number of factors. These factors include the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size, resources, nature, and structure of the employer\'s operation. Can an employer refuse to hire an applicant or fire a current employee who is illegally using drugs? Yes. Individuals who currently engage in the illegal use of drugs are specifically excluded from the definition of a ""qualified individual with a disability"" protected by the ADA when an action is taken on the basis of their drug use. Is testing for illegal drugs permissible under the ADA? Yes. A test for illegal drugs is not considered a medical examination under the ADA; therefore, employers may conduct such testing of applicants or employees and make employment decisions based on the results. The ADA does not encourage, prohibit, or authorize drug tests. Challenge the conventional. Create the exceptional.

Athletic Advising Information Fall Sports: Volleyball Men\'s Soccer Women\'s Soccer Spring Sports Baseball Softball Men\'s Tennis Women\'s Tennis Men\'s Golf Women\'s Golf Expand all General Information If there are concerns about a student-athlete, please contact their coach first. The coaches know these students the best. They communicate with their student-athletes daily and see them at least 6 days a week. The coaches care for our student-athletes and want what is best for them as people, students, and athletes. We will do everything we can to support the faculty and staff in their efforts to serve the students. Many student-athletes aspire to attend and compete at USC Sumter for two years. Some come to USC Sumter with dual enrollment credits. If a student expresses that they would like to remain at USC Sumter, although it may be better academically for them to transfer, please support their decision. It takes a lot of time, relationship building, and connection to recruit student-athletes. We want to provide them the information but also support them if they express a desire to stay. I understand there may be circumstances when a student-athlete will have so many credits that their financial aid is affected but if the student-athlete understands the full picture of financial aid and academics, please support their decision. Our student-athletes are active with Athletics from August 1st to the end of May, and therefore on campus. Study hall is required for all student-athletes and is regulated by their coaches. Season Information Men’s and women’s golf and men’s and women’s tennis will both compete in a short season over the fall that may require them to miss class. All other sports should not be missing classes in their off seasons. Men’s and Women’s Golf travel on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. There are no reschedules or options to change dates due to the golf course schedules. Each sport has an off-season where they are permitted to practice/train, condition, weight lift, and compete in scrimmages/friendlies. Student-Athlete Academic Schedule Most practice times will be in the afternoon. Student-athletes are encouraged to be done with classes by 2:15pm. Science Labs Fall sport student-athletes should take science labs in the spring (off-season). Spring sport student-athletes should take science labs in the fall (off-season). We understand there may be circumstances when this is not possible.', 'Transcripts Transcripts are required for all students applying to residency programs. Unofficial transcripts will be produced by the admissions office and provided to the DWS. The DWS will upload all transcripts prior to September 15th. If you would like an updated transcript to be uploaded to your application after September 15th, please contact Dr. Eric Williams at eric.williams@uscmed.sc.edu. Letters of Recommendation Most programs require a minimum of three letters of recommendation. ERAS allows you to store an unlimited number of letters and to designate different letters for each program. However, you can’t send more than four letters to an individual program. You should plan to ask for letters of recommendation at the end of your third year of medical school, between April and July, and no later than August of your fourth year. Be sure to give letter writers at least three to four weeks to write the letter. Potential letter writers may be attending physicians from third- or fourth-year rotations, department chairs, program directors, research collaborators, deans, and faculty with whom you worked in extracurricular activities. It’s best to avoid asking residents to write letters. Letter authors upload their letters to the ERAS system. Check individual program websites and ERAS program information for details on what types of letters of recommendation are expected and when they are due. Please note that the medical school staff (including the DWS and other members of Student Services) are not allowed to have access to any LoR. The DWS may assist authors or their designees with the steps required to upload a LoR but cannot upload the letter themselves. USMLE Transcript The USMLE transcript is required by many M.D. residency programs as part of an application to be considered for their positions. Applicants should research programs individually for requirements related to the USMLE transcript (i.e. minimum scores). Applicants must authorize the release of their USMLE transcript and assign it to the programs they designate. The NBME or ECFMG (for IMG Residency) charges a fee of $80 for transmitting USMLE transcripts to the programs designated by applicants. You can view the USMLE Requests Status Report to track the status of your USMLE requests by program. If you have a new score become available you must take action in MyERAS to resend USMLE scores to programs previously designated to receive them. Photographs University of South Carolina School of Medicine Columbia hires a photographer for all M.D. students to have a professional head shot taken at the end of the third year. It is recommended that this photo be uploaded to MyERAS. The photo is most often used by programs to help identify applicants when reporting for an interview. You should research programs individually to verify their requirements and use of the photo. Applicants must upload their own photo in MyERAS and then make assignments of the photo to the programs they designate. Please note that the photo file must meet the following requirements: File Type: JPG/JPEG or PNG Maximum File Size: 100 KB Maximum Dimensions: 2.5 in. x 3.5 in. Maximum Resolution: 150 DPI Transition to Residency Expand all Temporary License Information All who matched must complete the temporary license requirement of the institution/state of the residency. States have different license requirements, so it’s important that you review and complete all necessary paperwork in a timely fashion. Some forms cannot be completed until after your graduation day. In most cases, Dr. Rhinehart will need to sign and certify your date of graduation and/or degree completion. Forms that request the signature/verification of the “Dean” will be completed by him as well. If an official transcript is required by your residency program, the certified/official transcript will be available approximately three weeks after your graduation date. The cost of an official transcript is $12.00 and can be requested at the link below. Please do not request the transcript now but wait until after your graduation date. If you were to request it now, it may be sent without having your degree conferred. The link to request a transcript is: https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/transcripts_and_records/transcripts/index.php.

Small class sizes foster relationships with faculty who may turn into life-long mentors. Opportunities such as internships, research and service learning provide opportunities to apply your curriculum in hands-on settings, allowing you to prepare you for your future career and distinguish yourself as you pursue jobs or further education. Between our 36+ professional staff members and our Honors alumni network of over 10,000 graduates, you’ll have a great support system in the Honors College! Will I receive honors credit for my AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses? Most of our students earn college credit before graduating from high school. Credits earned via AP/IB/Cambridge tests or dual-enrollment are not counted toward honors requirements, but they do count towards the Carolina Core, as appropriate(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/undergraduate_admissions/requirements/for_freshmen/ap_ib_credits/) . These credits often serve as pre-requisites for upper-level courses and can allow room in your course of study for higher-level courses. You can discuss your options with your advisor. Why don\'t you accept AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses for Honors? The premise of an AP/IB or dual-enrollment course is that it is equivalent to a college course. They are not designed as Honors College courses. This is a common practice amongst honors colleges and programs across the country. How do students apply their AP/IB or dual-enrollment courses as Honors students? There are many ways! These credits often apply towards Carolina Core requirements, allowing students more flexibility in their schedule to take exploratory seminar classes. It is not uncommon for Honors students to double major or add a minor with room in their schedule due to credits earned in high school. Students may also choose to shorten their time in undergraduate studies by graduating early or taking graduate level coursework as a senior. Given the rigor of the Honors requirements, however, we do not generally see students graduate with honors in two or fewer years. All of these options can be tailored to your needs and discussed in-depth with your advisor. How are Honors students involved at USC? It is up to each student how much they want to get involved, but Honors students tend to do a lot outside the classroom, holding nearly 30% of leadership positions on campus, despite being about 8% of the undergraduate population. They are involved in band, Greek life, athletics, student government, community service and much more! Honors is full of motivated students and being in Honors will not prevent you from taking advantage of all the opportunities at the University of South Carolina. Have more questions?

Students who earn Graduation with Leadership Distinction demonstrate extensive, purposeful engagement beyond the classroom, understanding of course concepts in “real world” settings, and application of learning to make decisions and solve problems. Recognition This formal distinction honors the broader scope of achievements for students engaged within and beyond the classroom and sets them apart in ways worthy of recognition by others (e.g., potential employers, graduate schools). Students are recognized with graduation cords and the distinction appears on graduates’ transcripts and diplomas as “With Leadership Distinction in (Pathway Name)” or “With Leadership Distinction” on the diploma if multiple pathways are completed (with the complete list of pathways appearing on the transcript). Eligibility Students can earn Graduation with Leadership Distinction if they meet the requirements , have a cumulative GPA of 3.0 or greater, and graduate with an associate or baccalaureate degree in any major from USC Columbia, Lancaster, Salkehatchie, Sumter or Union. Failure to complete requirements (including submitting appropriate documentation for verification), forgery, or misrepresentation of experiences or documentation will result in the student being ineligible for GLD.

Charleston Mayor Joe Riley, who is retiring this year after leading the city since 1975, will deliver the commencement address. As students walk across the stage Monday for the final commencement of 2015, the university completes a record year for the number of students earning Graduation with Leadership Distinction on their diplomas. Nearly 40 students at the December commencement will receive the GLD honor, bringing the total of 2015 graduates to 248. These students engage in beyond-the-classroom learning, document their activities and reflect on their overall college experiences in an e-portfolio. The honor is posted on transcripts and diplomas, which can help as they apply to graduate schools or enter the job market. In 2014, there were 105 graduates with leadership distinction. Irma Van Scoy , director of USC Connect, says most students initially pursue the GLD because they want the recognition on their transcript and diploma. ""That\'s what gets them interested, but by the time they finish the process, they can really articulate the significance of their undergraduate education — what they have learned in class and out of class,"" Van Scoy says. ""They end up saying, \'This is one of the most valuable things I\'ve done at USC and now I know where I\'m going.\' "" More than 850 Carolina students are now pursuing the GLD recognition, with more than 300 expected to graduate in May 2016. Students in every college and school at the university, along with students from the four Palmetto College campuses, are represented in the program. Van Scoy says the GLD program has helped people understand integrated learning and offers students a chance to take related coursework, demonstrate what they\'ve learned through a presentation, reflect on their undergraduate experience and consider how they will apply learning to lead in the future. Students can choose one of four GLD paths: community service, global learning, professional and civic engagement or research. One of the students graduating Monday is Max D. Emory of Lancaster, S.C., who will earn his degree in mechanical engineering with leadership distinction in professional and civic engagement. He has accepted a position at Savannah River Nuclear Solutions\' Engineering Leadership Development Program. ""Outside of GLD allowing me to learn a lot about myself, it has really boosted my confidence and solidified my thoughts about who I am and what I am passionate about. GLD was not easy to obtain by any means and challenged me in different ways. With the help of my adviser, Lisa Camp, I really enjoyed my experience,"" Emory says. ""We, as college students, are involved in so many different things throughout our journey we don\'t take the time to look back at what we\'ve accomplished and learned. GLD gave me the opportunity to do just that. I learned a lot about my own experiences, that I thought were insignificant at the time but that really changed the way I think about things today. ""GLD has made me more excited for my future. Not that I wasn\'t excited before, but seeing other people excited about my passion and where I am headed has really energized me and reassured me that I am on the right track."" Grace Gardner of Cincinnati will graduate with a major of international studies and women\'s and gender studies and a minor in leadership studies. She plans to move home to Ohio, where she will explore a career in medicine, possibly in an accelerated nursing degree program. She also has applied to the Peace Corps. She chose to pursue GLD after she applied to be an Emerging Leaders Program mentor in the fall of her junior year. The interviewer pointed out that Gardner already had many of the pieces for the GLD. ""I\'m so glad I chose this track at USC because it gave meaning to all the positions I held in my time here.']","Graduation with Leadership Distinction will appear on your transcript and diploma, while Latin Honors and/or Departmental Honors may appear on your diploma depending on the specific honors you have earned.

Instruction may be delivered at one time and received at another (asynchronous) or delivered and received at the same time (synchronous). Many courses facilitate interaction among fellow classmates using discussion boards, live chat, blogs, wikis and virtual groups. Instructional Methods The following list includes online learning instructional methods used in courses at the University of South Carolina. Expand all 100% Web Asynchronous (DWEB) Course that is taught 100% online in which students complete activities and assignments on their own time to meet course deadlines. Example: All course materials are provided online and students follow a course schedule with assignments that must be completed by an established due date. 100% Web Synchronous (DWEBS) Course that is taught 100% online in which students are required to participate in online meetings/lectures at specific days and times. Example: Course meets online on Tuesday/Thursday. 100% Web Mix Asynchronous & Synchronous (DWEBM) Course that is taught 100% online in which students are required to participate in online meetings/lectures at specific days and times and also complete activities & assignments on their own time to meet course deadlines. Example: Course meets online on Monday and students have additional online activities/assignments to complete on their own time by a specific due date. Blended 50% or more web (BWEB) Course that is taught both face-to-face and online with 50% or more of the course offered online. Example: Course meets in-person on Monday and either: • Most activities/assignments are completed asynchronous online by students on their own time by a specific due date; or • The course meets online with synchronous instruction on Wednesday/Friday. Blended/Hybrid Up to 49% web (B3WEB) Course that is taught both face-to-face and online with 49% or less of the course offered online. Example: Course meets in-person on Monday/Wednesday and either: • Meets online on Friday with synchronous instruction; or • Activities/assignments are completed asynchronously online by students in lieu of a Friday meeting. Flexible Face-to-Face or Online (FLEX) Course that is taught in a traditional face-to-face classroom setting but also livestreamed online and recorded so students have the flexibility to choose the modality for any class sessions (HyFlex Model) Example: Course meets in-person on Monday/Wednesday/Friday in a classroom on campus that is livestreamed online and recorded. On any given day, student may choose to attend class sessions inperson, synchronously online (via livestream), or asynchronously online (via course recordings.) 100% Two-Way AV (DTWS) Course that is taught 100% via two-way video. Example: Course that meets specific days and times via two-way video delivered to a specific site (e.g. Columbia course delivered via two-way video to another system campus or specific site; Beaufort course taught on Bluffton campus delivered via two-way video to Beaufort campus; etc.) 50% or more Two-Way AV (BTWON) Course that is taught more than 50% via two-way video to a specific site. Example: Course that meets in-person on Monday and meets via two-way video to a specific site on Wednesday/Friday OR Course that meets via two-way video to a specific site on Monday/Wednesday with activities/assignments completed asynchronously online by students in lieu of a Friday meeting Other Distance Delivery (DOTH) Course that is considered an internship, clinical, or practicum course and is part of a 100% online program.

58,How do I re-enroll in a course from which I have been dropped?,"['On Campus Dual Enrollment Agreement High School Transcript : Every student must provide an official high school transcript. Before You Enroll If you decide to enroll in a course for dual credit, please be aware of the following facts: You are establishing a permanent college transcript so your success is very important. Dual enrollment courses do count toward the GPA and hours earned as part of a student’s first year in college which can affect eligibility for financial aid programs in the second year of college. Students are responsible for maintaining the academic standards of the University of South Carolina as stated in the USCL Student Handbook. Dropping a Course You must follow certain procedures and be aware of your high school’s deadline for schedule adjustment when dropping a course. If you would like to drop a course, check with your teacher to find out the last date to drop without a WF (withdrew failing) appearing on your USCL transcript. Simply changing your class schedule at the high school does not drop you from the official class roll. If you are taking classes at your high school, you must notify your school counselor that you wish to drop the course and the counselor will notify the Dual Enrollment Coordinator in writing. If you are taking classes on the university’s campus, you will need to go to the Office of Admissions to complete a withdrawal form. Failure to follow these procedures may result in an “F” being placed on your permanent University record. Transfer of College Credits At the end of the course, credit earned by satisfactory completion of dual enrollment courses (usually an earned grade of “C” or higher) will transfer to public South Carolina institutions, provided that the course is included on the List of Transferable Courses in the Statewide Transfer and Articulation Policy.(https://www.sctrac.org/) If the course is not included on the above list, you are responsible for contacting the higher education institution to see if the course credit will be accepted. If you plan on attending a private institution in South Carolina or any public or private institutions outside of South Carolina, you are responsible for contacting the institution and obtaining written assurance that the dual enrollment course credit will apply toward your degree requirements. Transcripts At the end of the course, you can check your grade and request a transcript online. To request credit transfer to schools other than USC, a student must have an official transcript sent to that school’s records office. If you are applying to more than one school, you can request an official transcript be sent to each one. Absences High School Dual Enrollment courses follow the standard attendance policy as stated in the USCL Academic Bulletin. Absence from more than 10 percent of the scheduled class sessions whether excused or unexcused is excessive and may result in a grade penalty. Testing Tests must be taken on the assigned dates. Makeup tests are only permitted in extreme cases. Confidentiality of Student Records In accordance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of l974, USCL students have the right to review, inspect, and challenge the accuracy of information kept in a cumulative file by the institution unless the student waives this right. It also ensures that records cannot be released in other than emergency situations without the written consent of the student. For more information on FERPA policy, see the USCL Student Handbook at the above referenced web page. Off-Campus Access to Library Resources Access to Medford Library’s Electronic Resources is available from off-campus to currently enrolled students using EZProxy access.

62,How are online exams administered?,"[""Providing help when they need it can greatly reduce student anxiety levels. Ask a colleague to read the exam to make sure all test items and instructions are understandable and do not cause confusion for your students. If you distribute a paper-based exam, be sure to double-check the documents for typographical errors before printing. For online exams, double-check your settings to ensure that the exam will go live at the expected time. For face-to-face courses, remind students about the date, day, time and room number for the final exam. Because they are often scheduled differently than your class sessions, students sometimes become confused about the day and time for finals. For online courses, remind students of the time and length of the exam, and reinforce the importance of securing a well-functioning computer and reliable Internet service before accessing the exam.

Instructors have full discretion to set their own policy regarding the late acceptance of course work missed due to an unexcused absence; this policy should be specified in the course syllabus. Examination Policies Final Examinations Final examinations for spring and fall semesters are held during a seven-day period at the close of each semester. Summer examinations are held during a two-day period at the close of each session. Semester examination schedules are published on the registrar’s Web site under the “Calendar” link. The results of these examinations, combined with the grades for class performance, determine the reports given at the end of the semester. No final examination may be held outside of the stated time without the special permission of the dean of the college concerned. Reading Day is specified in the University calendar and no exams, quizzes or required class attendance may be scheduled for that day. In any course or laboratory which meets two or three times per week, no quiz, test, or examination may be given during the last two class meetings prior to the regularly scheduled examination period. In any course or laboratory which meets once a week, no quiz, test, or examination may be given during the last class meeting prior to the regular examination period. In any course or laboratory which meets more than three times per week, no quiz, test, or examination may be given during the last three class meetings prior to the regular examination period. Self-paced courses are exempt from this regulation. If an instructor teaches more than one section of the same course, students may transfer from one examination section to another with the instructor’s permission. Students who are absent from any final examination will be given the grade of F on the course if they have not offered an excuse acceptable to the instructor. If excused, they will be assigned a grade of I (see “I” entry under “Grading System”), and may complete the course under the conditions specified by the instructor in the “Assignment of Incomplete Grade” form. Re-examinations for the purpose of removing an F or raising a grade are not permitted. Graduating Seniors No early examinations are given for graduating seniors. Students who have submitted a degree application may attend the graduation ceremony. Diplomas are mailed after final examinations and after a student’s dean has verified that all degree requirements have been met. Deferred Examinations A student with excused absences from final examinations in one semester has the privilege of deferred or special examinations and may take the deferred examination at the next regular examination period, with credit for semester standing, provided the examination is taken at the convenience of the professor. The examination must be taken within one calendar year from the time that the absence was incurred. Deferred examinations will be granted only in case of absence certified as unavoidable because of sickness or other cause, rendering attendance at final examinations impossible. Grading Policies Grading System Enrollment in a course obligates the student not only for prompt completion of all work assigned but also for punctual and regular attendance and for participation in whatever class discussion may occur. It is the student’s responsibility to keep informed concerning all assignments made. Absences, whether excused or unexcused, do not absolve the student from this responsibility. Students’ grades in their courses are determined by class standing and examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor may decide. Class standing is determined by the quality of a student’s work and the regularity of attendance in lectures and laboratory sessions or other exercises of the course. Grading systems in graduate and professional schools are described in the appropriate bulletins. A, B, C, D represent passing grades in order from highest to lowest. B+, C+, D+ may also be recorded. F represents failing performance. S and U indicate, respectively, satisfactory (passing) and unsatisfactory (failing) performance in courses carried under the Pass-Fail option. The S/U designation is used also for some research courses, workshops, and seminars in which the regular academic grades are not used. The use of the Pass-Fail grading option in such courses is indicated in their bulletin descriptions. No course carried under the Pass-Fail option will affect a student’s grade point average or the evaluation of suspension conditions. FN (Failure-Non Attendance) and UN (Unsatisfactory-Non Attendance) grades are assigned to students who never attended or have stopped attending class but have not officially dropped or withdrawn. Faculty are required to provide a last date of attendance when assigning this grade. The grade and the last date of attendance are used in determining the recalculation of awarded funds for financial aid recipients. Reporting the last date of attendance is critical to avoid potential financial liability for the institution.']","Online exams at the University of South Carolina are administered through the Learning Management System (LMS), typically Blackboard. Instructors create an assessment within the LMS and share it with students during the designated time window specified in the course syllabus. Students access the exam through the LMS, complete it within the allowed time frame, and submit it for grading. It is essential to secure a reliable internet connection and a well-functioning computer before starting the exam. Late submissions might not be accepted without a valid excuse, as per the instructor's policy outlined in the syllabus. Remember to review all instructions carefully to avoid confusion and ensure understanding of any penalties for not completing the exam within the allotted time without a valid reason.",The course instructor determines how exams are administered and you should consult the course syllabus for information about exams.,0.46153846153846156

For in-class examinations, a student who has technical problems in accessing or completing an electronic exam, a penalty may be given for providing him/her with a print copy. The penalty, if any, is specified in the course syllabus. In the case of virtually proctored electronic examinations, any student experiencing technical difficulties at the time of an exam is expected to contact the USC College of Pharmacy information technology (IT) support staff and the course coordinator upon realizing that a problem exists. Students are expected to arrive on time for scheduled exams. Students are expected to begin virtually proctored examinations at the respective course’s start time or as instructed by the course coordinator. Arriving late to an exam or starting a virtually proctored examination late when not due to technical difficulties reported to the course coordinator and IT staff are unprofessional and considered in violation of the professionalism policy. Grade sanctions for students arriving late to an exam are specified in each course syllabus. Students who are repeatedly late for exams will be referred to the Professionalism Committee. If a student is late to an exam for an extenuating circumstance, proof must be provided to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or Senior Associate Dean in order to prevent sanctions. Questions relating to exam content are strictly prohibited during the examination. Questions regarding suspected typing errors on the test (e.g. omissions, misnumbering, defective exam pages, etc.) are permitted, though may be addressed post-test in order to remain fair to students completing exams in alternate locations or on alternate dates. Food or beverages are not allowed during examinations. All food containers and beverages should be placed at the front or sides of the classroom along with book bags or otherwise stored in a separate location from the test-taker. Restroom breaks are discouraged during in-class examinations and prohibited during virtually proctored examinations. If restroom breaks are needed during an in-class examination, only one student at a time will be allowed to leave the exam room and a faculty member may accompany the student. Students must leave all belongings in the classroom in this situation to avoid perceived or real academic integrity incidences. Cheating in any form is not allowed and will be considered an honor code violation and immediately referred to the USC Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity. Course coordinators may enact grade sanctions for the course dependent on the USC Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity resolutions.

You should have received accommodation letters for students with disabilities who are enrolled in your course(s). Be sure to review the accommodation letters if you are providing an online exam. The most commonly used accommodation is extra time on exams. Be flexible. The length of time a student sits and views a computer screen can be problematic and students may need to use the restroom or stretch during a long exam. Clearly communicate expectations in a timely manner to all students (e.g., who to contact for technical issues, how the exam will be proctored, technology requirements, testing platform). If you have questions about considerations for students with disabilities, please contact the Student Disability Resource Center(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/index.php) at SADRC@mailbox.sc.edu . A student in my class is impacted by an extenuating circumstance that prevents them from completing the final exam during the established time period. What should I do? Similar to cases in which you might assign a grade of “Incomplete,” you should use your discretion to determine the extent of the problem and if possible require documentation of the issue (i.e. a written statement from a physician, counselor, safety officer, or other qualified professional). Do not retain such information in your course records; validate and discard. Understand that technical problems might also be an extenuating circumstance. Using your best judgement and interest in the student’s academic success, you may arrange an alternative time period and date(s) that is suitable to the student and you. What if a student has technology needs? Faculty should direct students to the Thomas Cooper Library with their Carolina Card to check out the technology that is needed.

Prerequisite Waivers If you have taken an AP or IB class, or are waiting for a class to transfer from another institution and this class satisfies a prerequisite for a class at UofSC, you will need to complete a prerequisite waiver.

Instead, we use a notification list to inform students when we open more seats for a course—whether it is for an existing section or for a new section. After those on the list are alerted of seat openings for a course, the seats become available on a first come, first served basis - whoever registers first for an open seat will get it. We cannot reserve any seats for individual students. It is therefore important to regularly check your USC email. You should also continue to monitor Self-Service Carolina in the event a seat becomes available because a student drops the course. Please be aware that even if you add your name to the notification list, there is no guarantee that more seats will be opened.

Faculty can not give overrides of any kind for any reason for any class. FAQs Expand all What if I want to get into a particular section of a course? There is no need to indicate the section you need. We will notify you whenever we create seats for a course, including if we create additional seats in the section you happen to need, whatever it is. When we notify you, you should also be sure to check whether there are new sections created of the course you want that will fit into your schedule. I was signed up for the section that I wanted, and now the instructor changed to a different section that is full? How do I get into the section the instructor is teaching now? We cannot accommodate this. The instructor that is assigned to a section can change or switch at any time prior to the semester or summer session starting. We try to indicate early on for some of the sections who the instructors will be, but there are a number of reasons that the instructors may need to change. We cannot assign a student to a particular instructor. How do I get an override for MATH 300 or for a 500 level MATH course? This is done the same way. Fill out the notification list indicated in the first question above. The only difference is that we may give you an override into the requested course and contact you directly. Note that an override does not register you for the course; you will still need to do that yourself. I saw some open seats, and I wasn't notified about them. What happened? We only notify students for courses when we create seats in them. There are other reasons seats can become available. In particular, if a student drops a section, which is out of our control, a seat will become available, but we will not know and will not notify you. I saw that an override was given for a course that I wanted, but you indicate that doesn't happen. What's up with that? Looks can be deceiving. Sometimes caps (the number of seats available in a course) are lowered (for example, to help us balance enrollments in different sections). This will cause an appearance that overrides were given. Also, enrollments in courses taught through the South Carolina Honors College or the Opportunities Scholars' Program are not handled through the Mathematics Department, even though they may be mathematics courses. We do not control how registration is handled for these, and overrides for students in these programs may occur for these courses. Challenge the conventional. Create the exceptional.

A student will be given credit for courses in which the grade of S is earned, but these courses will not affect the computation of the grade point average. Specific provisions of the Pass-Fail program are as follows: The Pass-Fail grading system is in effect for an indefinite period of time, subject to periodic review. The Pass-Fail option is not available to undergraduate students whose semester or cumulative GPA is less than 2.00. Students are permitted to exercise the Pass-Fail option only on free elective courses. Students are permitted to take no more than eight courses on a Pass-Fail basis during their undergraduate career. A student wishing to exercise the option must have the permission of the dean of the college and the student’s academic advisor. The Pass-Fail Option form (AS-20) is used for this purpose. The option may be elected or revoked by the student no later than the last date for withdrawing from the course without a penalty. Normal prerequisites may be waived for students taking a course on a Pass-Fail basis. Courses taken under this option will be excluded from the calculation of the grade point average. A grade of S will be entered by the Office of the University Registrar for a regularly assigned passing grade; a failing grade will be registered as U. No course carried on a Pass-Fail basis will be counted toward the hours required for either the President’s or the Dean’s Honor List. A verified learning-disabled student may take on a Pass-Fail basis an elective or required course which is not in the major if the academic advisory plan so recommends the Pass-Fail option for that course. A student who desires use of this option must apply to the dean of the college at the beginning of the semester.

Spring 2020 Undergraduate Pass-Fail Grading Approved by the USC Faculty Senate on April 1, 2020 To address complications presented by the COVID19 pandemic, the Faculty Senate Steering Committee approved the following grading accommodations for undergraduate students enrolled in Spring 2020. All courses will be graded as originally planned according to grading criteria in course syllabi. After grades are submitted at the end of the semester, undergraduates can choose, on a course-by-course basis, to request a pass/fail grade for the Spring 2020 semester with the exception of Graduate or professional school courses, which can be taken as pass/fail only when deemed appropriate by the program or school Dean. The following pass/fail scale will be used: Earned grades of A, B+, B, C+, and C will be replaced with S+, earned grades of D+ and D will be replaced with S, and an earned grade of F will be replaced with U. If students select the S+/S/U grading scale for a course, points will not be factored into the GPA. Courses with S+ and S will count towards earned semester hours. Courses graded with the S+/S/U scale, under this exception for Spring 2020, will count towards applicable curricular, major, continuation, and graduation requirements. For example, if a course requires a C or better in a prerequisite, students selecting this alternative grading scale would need an S+ in the prerequisite course. Faculty members will not be aware of students who select the pass/fail grading option when entering final grades. Grades will be entered in the format for which the course was approved. Students who previously decided to take a course on a pass/fail basis will continue on a pass/fail basis using the University’s established S/U system (e.g., S is earned if the grade is D or above and U is earned for grades below D). For the Spring 2020 semester, undergraduate students who choose to replace a course letter grade with the S+/S/U option must do so no later than July 1, 2020. This process will occur through the Office of the University Registrar. A form will be available on the University Registrar website for the student to request that a letter grade be replaced with the S+/S/U scale. USC will include a transcript note on all academic records, regardless of grading basis, indicating the extraordinary circumstances of the global public health emergency during Spring 2020.

69,May I take courses at another institution during the summer?,"['Note: These deadlines are subject to change at any time. Summer School Admission New students entering the University for the first time in a summer term who expect to continue studying toward a degree submit only one application. They must meet all requirements for admission as degree-seeking students before the beginning of the summer term. These students should not submit a separate application for the summer term. Summer Attendance Only Students who wish to attend the University for the summer only should refer to the “Admission as a Non-degree Seeking Candidate” paragraph included in this section. Students enrolled in degree programs at another college or university who wish to take summer courses at USC as transients should seek written approval to take specific courses from a dean or department chair at their home institution. Transfer Admission A transfer applicant is an individual who has attended another regionally accredited college or university following graduation of high school or completion of a GED. Requirements Transfer applicants must have a Cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher (4.0 scale). If fewer than 30 semester hours (45 quarter hours) of college-level work have been attempted, the applicant must also meet freshman admission requirements. Transfer Applicants Must Submit: Completed Application for Admission & Application Fee Official Transcripts Transcripts from all regionally accredited colleges and universities attended are required. Transcripts with in-progress work will not be accepted. If less than 30 semester hours (45 quarter hours) of college-level work were attempted, official high school transcripts or GED test scores are also required. Important Notes: A transfer grade point average is calculated using all credits attempted and all grades earned on college-level courses at regionally accredited institutions outside the USC System. Applicants with a GPA less than 2.0 (4.0 scale) will be reviewed by the designated admissions committee for a determination on admission to the institution. Applicants can update their start term within 365 days of submission. Transfer applicants are encouraged to apply 6-12 months prior to the term for which they seek admission. However, applications for admission will be accepted and reviewed year-round. Evaluation of Transfer Credits Transfer credits to USC must be from regionally accredited institutions for academic courses completed with grades of C- or better. Applicability of credits toward a particular degree is determined by the degree program in which the student enrolls. The number of credits acceptable to the University and the number which may apply toward a particular degree may differ. Original records are required for courses exempted at a previous college. Exemption credit or acceptance of transfer credit by another college has no bearing on the evaluation of transfer credit at the University of South Carolina. Students transferring to the University from another college or university must, before enrolling in class at the University, have their transcripts evaluated by the University. It is only in the light of such evaluation that students will know definitively the transferability and equivalency of each transfer course. Transferability refers to the conditions under which the University accepts credit for inclusion in the student’s record. Transfer courses must have been taken at a regionally accredited post-secondary institution, or, if taken at a foreign post-secondary institution, have been recommended by a NACES - member external evaluation service. Coursework classified as remedial by the University will appear on the student’s record, but will not be used to determine admission eligibility or a transfer GPA. Exceptions to this rule may be made by the Office of the Registrar when state scholarship eligibility rules require inclusion. Equivalency entails equating transfer credit, both in hours and content, to University of South Carolina coursework. The Registrar’s Office works with USC colleges and schools to coordinate the process of transfer evaluation to equate transfer courses directly to courses in the USC course catalog; to subject codes which represent subjects not offered at USC ; or to subject codes that identify courses as remedial/technical/non-accredited coursework. Applicability of credit toward a degree refers to the prerogative of academic divisions to count specific credit toward the fulfillment of a student’s degree requirements. The student’s college, school or campus of enrollment is responsible for determining applicability. However, a transfer course is generally not applicable towards any University of South Carolina academic program or degree if: The transfer course was occupational or technical in nature (examples: welding, paralegal, radiography courses). The transfer course was essentially remedial in nature (example: Developmental English). A grade lower than 2.0 on a 4 point scale, or equivalent, was earned in the transfer course. The transfer course was taken by a degree-seeking University of South Carolina student without prior approval as described in the Earning Credit in Transient Status section of this bulletin. The transfer course was taken while a student was on an academic suspension from a University of South Carolina campus.', ""Summer Courses - College of Hospitality, Retail and Sport Management | University of South Carolina Skip to Content College of Hospitality, Retail and Sport Management SC.edu Study Colleges and Schools College of Hospitality, Retail and Sport Management Study Summer Courses Summer Courses Make the most of your summer by taking classes with the University of South Carolina's College of Hospitality, Retail and Sport Management.

Undergraduate students can choose from over 90 minors offered by USC, including eight below offered by the College of Engineering and Computing. Who should minor in engineering or computing? A minor is generally an optional degree component. A minor allows you to specialize in an area related to your major, broaden your education and enhance your degree, or study something completely different if you have multiple interests. A minor shows employers and graduate schools that you are hardworking and can handle an additional workload. On top of that, an engineering or computing minor is a bonus form of experience for entering certain job markets. Declaring a minor will require you to complete around six classes in the minor field of study. These courses may be in addition to your major program of study or may overlap with some of your normal program requirements. Before adding a minor, determine if the minor will extend your time to graduation, and if so, if the valued added is worth it; it often is. If you think a minor might be right for you, talk with your advisor. Engineering and Computing Minors Expand all Aerospace Engineering Minor The Aerospace Engineering Minor is designed for students who want to enhance the breadth of a mechanical engineering or related program of study with depth in the field of aerospace engineering. Students who complete this minor develop engineering analysis and design skills necessary for creating and understanding aerospace vehicles and their subsystems.

71,What is a second major?,"['Second Major In some degree programs, a student may elect a second major. Normally, second majors are possible only in degree programs with similar general education requirements. The second major option is not available in all colleges. The student must meet admission and progression requirements for the second major. The student must have received approval from both deans for a second major. All requirements for the second major must be fulfilled. All general education and special departmental requirements normally associated with the second major must be fulfilled. In cases where the first major and the second major lead to different degrees, the student must designate one as the official degree of record. A second major eliminates the cognate requirement; however, special departmental requirements normally completed as part of the cognate are not waived. Fulfillment of the requirements for a second major are indicated on the student’s official transcript upon graduation. No notation for a second major is placed on the official transcript for course work completed after graduation. Students who submit two degree applications for the same degree in the same college for a double major will receive one diploma. Indebtedness It is expected that students will discharge any indebtedness to the University as quickly as possible. No diploma, certificate, or enrollment verification will be issued to or for students who have not made satisfactory settlement with the Office of Financial Services for all of their indebtedness to the University. In certain circumstances, transcripts may also be withheld. Records, Transcript, and Enrollment Certification Policies Change of Name or Address It is the obligation of every student to notify the Office of the University Registrar of any change in name or address (including electronic address).

If they are pursuing a double major, a minor or cognate is not necessary. If they are pursuing a double degree, the student will need to choose a minor or cognate to graduate. The different between a double major and double degree follows: It is a double major if the students\' other course of study is a major within the College of Arts and Sciences, such as English. A double degree is when a student takes a second major outside of the College of Arts and Sciences, such as Business. Students must earn a ""C"" or better for a class to count towards a minor or cognate. Note that pre-med, pre-law and pre-pharmacy cannot be minors. They can qualify as cognates but classes must be taken at the appropriate level. Notes on Cognates Please note to your students who choose the cognate option that most areas of study require them to take courses at the 300-level. For example, if a student wants to pursue an ""education cognate,"" all their courses should start at the 300-level and higher. There are exceptions to this rule such as philosophy cognates which can begin at the 200-level. The exceptions can be found in the student handbook. Minor Bulletin Encourage your students to choose a minor as soon as possible. Some minors require classes which are only offered in certain semesters or require prerequisites. The current minor bulletin can be found on the Undergraduate Bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/) . Senior Checks Students are advised to get a senior check done for them the semester before the semester they plan to graduate (so if they are graduating in May of any given year, they should do their senior check in the previous fall semester). This way, the undergraduate office in combination with the Dean\'s office can catch any errors in the student\'s file or warn them of classes they need to finish in order to graduate.
