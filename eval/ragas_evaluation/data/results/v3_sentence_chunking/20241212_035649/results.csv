1,Can a program include more than one concentration?,"I apologize, but I don't have any relevant information to answer your question. Please try asking something about USC.",complete,,0.0,5,0,"Yes,programs may have multiple concentrations within the major."
2,Can I choose specific (prescribed) courses as part of the Carolina Core for my program?,"Yes, you can choose specific courses as part of the Carolina Core for your program. The Carolina Core is a set of requirements that students across the University of South Carolina have to complete as part of their program of study. The Carolina Core is made up of 10 core components, each with learning outcome and credit hour requirements.

For example, if you are studying in the College of Arts and Sciences, you will have to take at least one Additional Humanities class, one Founding Documents course, and one U.S. History/Non-U.S. History class, among others. These courses will count towards your Carolina Core requirements as well as your College Requirements.

To find the entire list of Carolina Core applicable courses, as well as the requirements that they fulfill, you can refer to the most recent academic bulletin. Also, prototypical syllabi are available for all Carolina Core courses, which illustrate options for tailoring the syllabi for individual classes.

Keep in mind that your advisor can help guide you in choosing the right courses for your program and the Carolina Core.",complete,,4.229397732846058,5,5,Yes.

3,Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,"When making changes to a cross-listed course, it typically affects all cross-listed courses as well since these courses share the same curriculum. However, if the changes only concern specific aspects such as pre-/co-requisites or variable credit hours involving another department/program, a letter of concurrence may be required. It is essential to ensure that all necessary approvals and adjustments are completed before implementing any modifications to maintain consistency across the cross-listed courses.",complete,,-1.886481761932373,5,1,Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Getting approval for distributed learning for one cross-listed course does not automatically approve cross listed courses for distributed learning delivery.

108,What is a second major?,"To have a second major at the University of South Carolina, a student in the College of Arts and Sciences may complete a second major within the College of Arts and Sciences or the School of Music (Bachelor of Arts track only). The student must complete all collegiate requirements, including general education courses and special departmental requirements, as well as the major requirements for the second major. In cases where one major is part of a Bachelor of Arts program and the other is part of a Bachelor of Science program, the student must designate one as the official degree of record. A second major eliminates the cognate requirement, but special departmental requirements normally completed as part of the cognate are not waived. Fulfillment of the requirements for a second major is indicated on the student’s official transcript upon graduation. No notation for a second major is placed on the official transcript for course work completed after graduation. Students who submit two degree applications for the same degree in the same college for a double major will receive one diploma. Indebtedness is expected to be discharged as quickly as possible. No diploma, certificate, or enrollment verification will be issued to or for students who have not made satisfactory settlement with the Office of Financial Services for all of their indebtedness to the University.",complete,,3.6306804141998295,5,4,"If you are a student in the College of Arts and Sciences,you may complete a second major within the College of Arts and Sciences or the School of Music (Bachelor of Arts track only).
