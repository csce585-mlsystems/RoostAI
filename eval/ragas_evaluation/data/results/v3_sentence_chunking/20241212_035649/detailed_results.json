      "Teaching and Advising - Office of the Provost | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Office of the Provost SC.edu About Offices and Divisions Office of the Provost Our Offices Undergraduate Studies Carolina Core For Faculty and Staff Teaching and Advising Teaching and Advising Teaching the Core There are two types of Carolina Core courses. Foundational courses are taken early in the undergraduate experience and apply across disciplines. Integrative courses are taken near the end of study and apply to discipline-specific majors. Colleges and programs will also have specific requirements in each major and in some cases will have a list of recommended Carolina Core courses. Faculty members teaching a foundational Carolina Core course will need to adopt the relevant Carolina Core learning outcomes particular to that class. All Carolina Core courses must cover the learning outcomes identified in the template syllabi of approved Core courses. Instructors may add additional course content, but the essential outcomes must be covered. An interactive list of Faculty Senate-approved courses meeting the Carolina Core requirements is available online. Prototypical syllabi are available for all Carolina Core courses. They include student achievements and illustrate options for tailoring the syllabi for individual classes. Select a course from the approved list to view the syllabus or see the Carolina Core Syllabus Requirements for Teaching [pdf] . Advising Students on the Core The Carolina Core curriculum covers students who entered USC-Columbia, Lancaster, Salkehatchie, Sumter, or Union, for the first time in Fall 2012 or later. Students earn a degree under curricular requirements in force when they first enroll in a baccalaureate program at any campus of the University of South Carolina.

What Makes up my Program of Study? In the College of Arts and Sciences, your program of study consists of the following requirements: Carolina Core, College Requirements, Electives, Program courses, Major courses, and either a Minor or Cognate. CAS programs require between 120 to 128 credit hours to graduate, depending upon your major. Learn more about the requirements below. Carolina Core The Carolina Core(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/) is a set of requirements that students across the University of South Carolina have to complete as part of their program of study. The Carolina Core is made up of 10 core components, each with a learning outcome and credit hour requirements. Click below on each requirement to learn more. You can find the entire list of Carolina Core applicable courses, as well as the requirements that they fulfill in the most recent academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/carolina-core-courses/#foundationalcoursestext) . College Requirements The College Requirements are different from the Carolina Core, in that they are only required for the specific college in which you are studying. While looking at the separate components of the Carolina Core above, you may have noticed that there is some overlap between Carolina Core and College Requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences. Click on each College Requirement below to learn more. For more information on the College Requirements, follow the link to the College of Arts and Sciences College Requirements on the academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/arts-sciences/#text) . Expand all Additional Humanities Every student within the College of Arts and Sciences is required to take at least one additional Humanities class. Students who are pursuing a BS are only required to take 3 hours of additional Humanities, while students who are pursuing a BA are required to take 9 hours of Additional Humanities (3 classes). Please see your advisor for a list of applicable courses. Founding Documents The Founding Documents requirement is required for students who entered USC in Fall 2021 or later. There are seven courses that can apply go towards this requirement, and they focus on America\u2019s Founding Documents and works about African American\u2019s struggles for freedom. Learn more about the Founding Documents requirement(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/internal/undergrad_students/founding_documents.php) . Expand all Tip: Have you taken HIST 111 to satisfy one of your GHS requirements? If so, HIST 111 will also count towards the Founding Documents requirement! The Founding Documents requirement is the only other place in your program of study besides the overlay, where one course can fulfill two requirements. Talk to your advisor about how to make the most out of the classes you take! Foreign Language As stated in the GFL section of the Carolina Core, as a CAS student, you will need to reach the 122 level of foreign language of your choice. How many hours of foreign language you will have to take is dependent on your Foreign Language Placement Test(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) score. You must register in advance to take this Placement test. Once you have your score, your advisor will help you register(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) for the appropriate foreign language class. Social Science As part of the CAS College Requirements, you will need one GSS Carolina Core and an additional Social Sciences class. While any of the GSS courses can apply towards this requirement, you can always ask your advisor for a list of applicable courses. U.S. History/Non-U.S. History The College of Arts and Sciences requires you to take both a US History class, as well as a Non-U.S. History class. One will count towards your Carolina Core GHS requirement and the second will apply towards your GHS College Requirement. (It doesn\u2019t matter which goes where, just that both are completed.)",

It has 10 Core components, each with learning outcomes and credit hour requirements. The Core begins with foundational courses early in the undergraduate experience, followed by one or more integrative courses near the end in which selected Core learning outcomes are integrated into the chosen major. Each of the ten Core components must be met with a Core-approved course. While most Core-approved courses fulfill a single Core component, a few courses, called overlay-eligible courses, have been approved to fulfill two Core components. Every student is required to complete a minimum of 31 credit hours of Core-approved courses. Transfer students who enter USC Columbia, Lancaster, Salkehatchie, Sumter, or Union are subject to the Carolina Core requirements. Any transfer courses that equate to Carolina Core courses will equate to both content and all outcomes associated with the USC Course.

For example, if the course is offered for 1-3 credits, a grading scale and assignments must be provided for 1 credit, 2 credits, and 3 credits. Is the number of times this course may be taken for credit greater than 1? (The statement is asking how many times it can be counted on the transcript as part of the program of study--not whether it can be repeated if failed. Only special topics courses or possibly internships should have a number greater than 1. Is this one of those?) Course Proposals Requiring Syllabi New courses (including new cross-lists) and courses that involves a significant change in course description, a change in Carolina Core or GLD designation, or a change in delivery mode to >50% online require a file syllabus. The following checklist items apply. Designator, Title, Course Info Does the course title in the proposal match that in the syllabus? Does the syllabus indicate the instructors' name as well as course meting days, times, and location (or equivalent)? Does the bulletin description in the proposal match that in the syllabus? Pre- or Co-requisites Are the pre/co-requisites included in the syllabus and do they match those in/proposed for the bulletin? Special Topics and Independent Studies These course are often variable credit and can be taken multiple times. The proposal should include the range of hours, number of times the course can be taken for credit and the maximum number of credit hours that can be applied to the degree. The Number of times the course can be taken for credit is not how many attempts a student can have to pass the course, but is how many times it can be taken, usually under different topics or studies. Example: Credit hours minimum for a single offering is 1. Credit hours maximum for a single offering is 6. Number of times the course can be taken is 6. Number of credit hours if course can be taken multiple times is 12. Is this all correct in the proposal? Learning Outcomes Does the syllabus include \"Learning Outcomes\" and use that exact phrase (as opposed to \"Learning Objectives\" etc.)? Do the Learning Outcome describe significant and essential learning that students will achieve and can reliably demonstrate at the end of a course, e.g., \"By the end of the course, students will: ....\"? Do the statements follow best-practices, particularly with respect to action verbs that identify quantifiable or measurable actions? See https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/coursedevelopment/learning_outcomes/(https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/course_design_development_delivery/learning_outcomes/index.php) and www.apu.edu/live_data/files/333/blooms_taxonomy_action_verbs.pdf(http://www.apu.edu/live_data/files/333/blooms_taxonomy_action_verbs.pdf) If this is a 500/600 level course is there at least one learning outcome specific to graduate students? This should connect to an assignment specific to graduate students. Caroline Core Course? If this is a Carolina Core Course: Does the proposal specify one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core? If this is proposed as an overlay course, does it include at least one learning outcome from CMS, INF, or VSR? Is the offering colleges/department expert in the content pertaining to the learning outcome? If course content potentially overlaps with content offered by another program, has a letter of concurrence been provided? Policy Statements Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding academic integrity? Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding attendance policy? Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding students with disabilities? Evaluation Does this syllabus specify assignments, projects, quizzes, and/or exams with brief descriptions of expectations and points/weights assigned to each activity? Does the syllabus clearly indicate the grading scale, weight of each assignment (points or percentage), and how grades will be assigned? If standard grades are used, does the syllabus indicate how letters A-F will be assigned (by points or percentage)?"

      "Carolina Core Online - Center for Teaching Excellence | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Center for Teaching Excellence SC.edu About Offices and Divisions Center for Teaching Excellence About Center for Teaching Excellence News 2017 News Archive Carolina Core Online Carolina Core Online Fewer than 30% of Carolina Core courses are offered online or in a blended format. The Center for Teaching Excellence determined that students at USC would benefit by having a greater variety of high-quality Distributed Learning (DL) course options for fulfilling their Core requirements. DL courses include fully online and blended courses (courses that meet in a traditional classroom, studio, or lab for up to 50% of the instruction and deliver the remaining instruction online.) With support from the Office of the Provost, CTE invited full time faculty at the USC Columbia or the Palmetto College campuses to submit proposals for the development of exemplary Carolina Core courses for distributed learning (DL) delivery. Four proposals were selected to receive Carolina Core Online: Teaching Innovation Grants in Distributed Learning Course Development for the 2016-2017 school year. In addition to funding of $6,000, grant recipients receive expert instructional design assistance, pedagogical resources, and technological support to convert existing Core courses for DL delivery. All the proposals selected this year are for the development of fully online asynchronous courses in which 100% of the instruction is offered online, with no required synchronous class meetings. Two proposals focus on transforming film and media face-to-face courses to fully online classes. Mark Minett\u2019s class, Introduction to Film and Media Studies (FAMS 240) is a foundation course that meets the Aesthetic and Interpretive Understanding Carolina Core outcome. Introducing students to the study of moving image media, students in this course analyze and discuss numerous examples of film, television, and web-based media. As such, online delivery will enhance learner opportunities to access these materials. Mark Cooper will develop for online delivery, Film and Media History (FAMS 300) which fulfills the Global Citizenship and Multicultural Understanding: Historical Thinking requirement in the Carolina Core. Through videos highlighting key issues and examples from the past two millennia of media history, Dr. Cooper will provide students well beyond the Columbia campus with a rich learning experience that was previously available only to students in the traditional face-to-face course. Also fulfilling the Global Citizenship and Multicultural Understanding: Historical Thinking requirement in the Carolina Core is Kathryn \u201cKay\u201d Edwards\u2019 course European History from Ancient Times to Mid-Seventeenth Century (HIST 101). Having taught this course face-to-face for many years, she looks forward to incorporating rich digital resources and interactive web-based materials into the curriculum, encouraging students to assess sources critically and appreciate how these sources form our narratives about the past. Carla A. Pfeffer\u2019s project will transform the popular Sociology of Sex Role into a fully online course. In this course, students develop an understanding of the ways in which sex, gender, race, class, sexuality, age, ability, and other factors shape the experiences and opportunities of both individuals and groups. The traditional version of Sociology of Sex Roles often fills to capacity within the first week of enrollment, frequently generating a waiting list of interested students. Offering this course in an online format will respond to student demand and provide additional opportunities for students to access this important course. Karen E. Edwards, Associate Director for Distributive Learning at CTE who facilitates cohort meetings during the grant period to discuss course development and DL best practices, is excited about this new CTE initiative. \u201cAll of us on CTE\u2019s Distributed Learning team are thrilled to be working with these outstanding faculty to provide students with additional high-quality online Carolina Core courses.\u201d Mark Minett Assistant Professor Film and Media Studies Department of English Language and Literature Mark Cooper Professor and Director Film and Media Studies Department of English Language and Literature Karen \"Kay\" Edwards Professor Department of History Carla Pfeffer Assistant Professor Sociology and Women's and Gender Studies Challenge the conventional.

What Makes up my Program of Study? In the College of Arts and Sciences, your program of study consists of the following requirements: Carolina Core, College Requirements, Electives, Program courses, Major courses, and either a Minor or Cognate. CAS programs require between 120 to 128 credit hours to graduate, depending upon your major. Learn more about the requirements below. Carolina Core The Carolina Core(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/) is a set of requirements that students across the University of South Carolina have to complete as part of their program of study. The Carolina Core is made up of 10 core components, each with a learning outcome and credit hour requirements. Click below on each requirement to learn more. You can find the entire list of Carolina Core applicable courses, as well as the requirements that they fulfill in the most recent academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/carolina-core-courses/#foundationalcoursestext) . College Requirements The College Requirements are different from the Carolina Core, in that they are only required for the specific college in which you are studying. While looking at the separate components of the Carolina Core above, you may have noticed that there is some overlap between Carolina Core and College Requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences. Click on each College Requirement below to learn more. For more information on the College Requirements, follow the link to the College of Arts and Sciences College Requirements on the academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/arts-sciences/#text) . Expand all Additional Humanities Every student within the College of Arts and Sciences is required to take at least one additional Humanities class. Students who are pursuing a BS are only required to take 3 hours of additional Humanities, while students who are pursuing a BA are required to take 9 hours of Additional Humanities (3 classes). Please see your advisor for a list of applicable courses. Founding Documents The Founding Documents requirement is required for students who entered USC in Fall 2021 or later. There are seven courses that can apply go towards this requirement, and they focus on America\u2019s Founding Documents and works about African American\u2019s struggles for freedom. Learn more about the Founding Documents requirement(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/internal/undergrad_students/founding_documents.php) . Expand all Tip: Have you taken HIST 111 to satisfy one of your GHS requirements? If so, HIST 111 will also count towards the Founding Documents requirement! The Founding Documents requirement is the only other place in your program of study besides the overlay, where one course can fulfill two requirements. Talk to your advisor about how to make the most out of the classes you take! Foreign Language As stated in the GFL section of the Carolina Core, as a CAS student, you will need to reach the 122 level of foreign language of your choice. How many hours of foreign language you will have to take is dependent on your Foreign Language Placement Test(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) score. You must register in advance to take this Placement test. Once you have your score, your advisor will help you register(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) for the appropriate foreign language class. Social Science As part of the CAS College Requirements, you will need one GSS Carolina Core and an additional Social Sciences class. While any of the GSS courses can apply towards this requirement, you can always ask your advisor for a list of applicable courses. U.S. History/Non-U.S. History The College of Arts and Sciences requires you to take both a US History class, as well as a Non-U.S. History class. One will count towards your Carolina Core GHS requirement and the second will apply towards your GHS College Requirement. (It doesn\u2019t matter which goes where, just that both are completed.)"

      "Learning outcomes describe the measurable skills, abilities, knowledge or values that students should be able to demonstrate as a result of completing a course. They are student-centered rather than teacher-centered, in that they describe what the students will do, not what the instructor will teach. All learning outcomes should be measurable and use action verbs (see Action Words for Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy).(https://www.citadel.edu/ceitl/wp-content/uploads/sites/54/Blooms-Taxonomy-for-Creating-Outcomes.pdf) For more on Learning Outcomes and program-specific examples, visit CTE Learning Outcomes(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/course_design_development_delivery/learning_outcomes/) . Sample Language for a Syllabus After successful completion of this course, you will be able to: Analyze diverse texts across genres and media. Apply strategies for close reading and critical analysis. Create comprehensive writing processes - including invention, planning, drafting, revision, and editing. Develop effective college-level expository and analytical essays. Evaluate the reliability and credibility of sources in academic writing. Discuss course texts and papers in progress. Develop a writing style appropriate for academic audiences that is clear, effective, and free of major errors. For Distributed Learning Courses Include a statement in this section verifying that \u201cThe learning outcomes are equivalent to those of a face-to-face (F2F) version of the course.\u201d * Instructional Methods Describe what students should expect in regard to your instructional methods. The description may include your lecture format, group work, presentation, the use of instructional technology and the use of the Blackboard Learning Management system. Sample Language for a Syllabus The course will be taught using multiple instructional methods. These methods will include lecture, group projects and oral presentations with an associated critical discussion. Typically, course topics will be introduced via a 2-3 lecture format incorporating interpretive discussions. Directly following the lecture presentation, you will receive an article from the primary literature that either illustrates current research on the topic or explores a related or relevant additional concept. Literature discussions will utilize small group discussions followed by classroom presentation and discussion. For Distributed Learning Courses Describe what students should expect from the course format. The description may include expectations of an online course versus a face-to-face course, the structure of weekly modules, and an overview of expected learning activities. Sample Language for a Syllabus This is a fully online course. Online classes are not easier than face-to-face lecture classes. To succeed in an online class, you must be extremely motivated and well-organized. You must purchase the required textbook listed above by the first day of the course. Other course materials are available via Blackboard (\u201cBb\u201d). Regular Internet access is essential for successful completion of the course. The typical class structure will consist of learning modules, which include: Short Video/PowerPoint Lectures Readings Online Discussions Group Projects Video Presentations Exams Field Exercises Written Exercises This is an entirely Web-based course. We have no face-to-face class meetings, and you will complete your work asynchronously \u2013 which simply means that you will be working on it at different times than your colleagues. It is important to understand that this is not a self-paced class or an independent study. You will have assigned deadlines, and work must be submitted on time. You may not save up your assignments to complete in the last weeks or days of the semester. One critical part of this class is regular interaction with other students and with me, your instructor. Each assignment sequence must be completed on schedule \u2013 you can't work ahead or get behind and be successful. * Course Communication and Feedback Describe the method and turnaround time of course communications and feedback. Sample Language for a Syllabus I will communicate with you regarding grades and assignments. If you need to contact me, the best method is via email. Generally, I will reply to emails within 24 hours and will provide feedback on assignments within 72 hours. You may also post questions pertaining to the course on the Blackboard Discussion Board. These questions will be answered within 24 hours. If you are having trouble with this course or its material, you should contact me via email to discuss the issues. Announcements will be posted to this course whenever necessary. If there is any other information that I think is important, then I will send it to your email address listed in Blackboard.",

They are student-centered rather than teacher-centered, in that they describe what the students will do, not what the instructor will teach. Introduction Learning outcomes are not standalone statements. They must all relate to each other and to the title of the unit and avoid repetition. Articulating learning outcomes for students is part of good teaching. If you tell students what you expect them to do, and give them practice in doing it, then there is a good chance that they will be able to do it on a test or major assignment. That is to say, they will have learned what you wanted them to know. If you do not tell them what they will be expected to do, then they are left guessing what you want. If they guess wrong, they will resent you for being tricky, obscure or punishing. Why Learning Outcomes? Learning outcomes help faculty to: Decide our emphasis in the course: Of all the things we could teach, what should we teach? Decide how best to teach: Teaching students to analyze requires different teaching approaches from teaching students to memorize. Decide how best to assess learning: Do I need a project or a final exam? Communicate expectations to students: What are our decisions on the matters above? Learning outcomes help students by: Creating a connection between teaching and learning, between professors and students Taking much of the guessing out of the student's attempt to learn Enabling them to truly master the content of the course Learning outcomes need to be SMART . Specific : The learning outcome should be well defined and clear. It states exactly what will be accomplished. Measurable : The learning outcome should provide a benchmark or target so that the institution can determine when the target has been reached, by how much it has been exceeded or by how much it has fallen short. Agreed Upon : Important stakeholders must be in general agreement with the institution\u2019s mission, goals and learning outcomes. Stakeholders may include university, school administration, faculty, students, alumni and/or community members. Realistic : Learning outcomes should be reasonable given the available resources. Learning outcomes should neither be easy nor impossible to attain, but somewhere in between. Time-Framed : A learning outcome should include a specific date by which it will be completed. It is important to allow enough time to successfully implement the steps needed to achieve the objective, but not so much as to elicit procrastination. Click on the Expand All + sign to view the elements of a Learning Outcome Statement Expand all Format of the Learning Outcome Statement Bloom\u2019s Revised Taxonomy provides the framework for writing course-level learning outcomes. Each learning outcome is represented by a sentence that consists of an action verb related to a cognitive process and a clearly defined content related to a specific knowledge type. All learning outcomes have a common format: Subject Verb Object S V O The SUBJECT of the Learning Outcome Statement The SUBJECT of the learning outcome statement is the student or the learner. Examples : Each student will be able to use word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and presentation graphics in preparing their final research project and report. Upon completion of the module on educational objectives, students will be able to classify specific educational objectives into the cognitive (knowing), psychomotor (doing) and affective (feeling) learning domains. The VERB of the Learning Outcome Statement Each verb in a learning outcome statement represents a cognitive process. Learning outcomes should consider the different types of cognitive processes involved in knowledge retention and transfer. Cognitive Process Description Remember Retrieve relevant knowledge from long-term memory Understand Construct meaning from oral, written, and graphic communication Apply Carry out or use a procedure in a given situation Analyze Break material into its constituent parts and determine how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose Evaluate Make judgments based on criteria and standards Create Put elements together to form a structure or reorganize elements into a new structure The Cognitive Process Dimension s shows action verbs in increasing order of complexity that are directly related to cognitive processes.

Each learning outcome is represented by a sentence that consists of an action verb related to a cognitive process and a clearly defined content related to a specific knowledge type. All learning outcomes have a common format: Subject Verb Object S V O The SUBJECT of the Learning Outcome Statement The SUBJECT of the learning outcome statement is the student or the learner. Examples : Each student will be able to use word processing, spreadsheets, databases, and presentation graphics in preparing their final research project and report. Upon completion of the module on educational objectives, students will be able to classify specific educational objectives into the cognitive (knowing), psychomotor (doing) and affective (feeling) learning domains. The VERB of the Learning Outcome Statement Each verb in a learning outcome statement represents a cognitive process. Learning outcomes should consider the different types of cognitive processes involved in knowledge retention and transfer. Cognitive Process Description Remember Retrieve relevant knowledge from long-term memory Understand Construct meaning from oral, written, and graphic communication Apply Carry out or use a procedure in a given situation Analyze Break material into its constituent parts and determine how the parts relate to one another and to an overall structure or purpose Evaluate Make judgments based on criteria and standards Create Put elements together to form a structure or reorganize elements into a new structure The Cognitive Process Dimension s shows action verbs in increasing order of complexity that are directly related to cognitive processes. Please note that verbs such as list, state, and write cannot be used as verbs in learning outcome statements because they do not have anything to do with cognitive processes.

      "Include the best way to communicate with you (e.g., telephone, Blackboard Collaborate Ultra, instant messaging). Instructional Design Expand all The course is organized in modules. Structure your course in manageable sections so students can easily locate course content. Include all course content (readings, videos, assignments, assessments, etc.) within the module. Modules can be organized by chapters, units, weeks, topics, or other organizational structures. Course content should be logically sequenced in the order students access the materials. Course learning outcomes are measurable and clear. Learning outcomes describe the measurable skills, abilities, knowledge, or values that students should be able to do or demonstrate as a result of a completing your course. Learning outcomes are student-centered rather than instructor-centered, in that they describe what the students will do, not what the instructor will teach. Course learning outcomes should be SMART: Specific: The learning outcome should be well defined and clear. It states exactly what will be accomplished. Measurable: The learning outcome should provide a benchmark or target so that the institution can determine when the target has been reached, by how much it has been exceeded or by how much it has fallen short. Agreed Upon: Important stakeholders must be in general agreement with the institution\u2019s mission, goals and learning outcomes. Stakeholders may include university, school administration, faculty, students, alumni and/or community members. Realistic: Learning outcomes should be reasonable given the available resources. Learning outcomes should neither be easy nor impossible to attain, but somewhere in between. Time-Framed: A learning outcome should include a specific date by which it will be completed. It is important to allow enough time to successfully implement the steps needed to achieve the objective, but not so much as to elicit procrastination. Carolina Core courses are required to have uniformed learning outcomes. You should not modify Carolina Core learning outcomes \u2013 even if they are not measurable or clear. If the learning outcomes for your Carolina Core course are not measurable, be sure to create measurable and clear module learning objectives. Additional Resources Learning Outcomes(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/course_design_development_delivery/learning_outcomes/) Revised Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy Action Verbs(https://www.gowrishankarnath.com/files/NorthEastern_University_Blooms_Taxonomy.pdf) Carolina Core \u2013 Learning Outcomes and Syllabus Guides(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/faculty-and-staff/learning-outcomes.php) Module learning objectives are measurable, clear, and consistent with the course learning outcomes. Similar to course learning outcomes, module learning objectives describe the measurable skills, abilities, knowledge, or values that students should be able to do or demonstrate as a result of completing a module. The objectives should align with course learning outcomes. Module learning objectives describe specific skills students should learn within the module. Additional Resources Writing Module Learning Objectives(https://teaching.charlotte.edu/teaching-guides/course-design/writing-module-level-objectives) Writing Module-Based Learning Objectives(https://www.adelphi.edu/fcpe/programs/online-and-blended-course-development/resources-for-planning-and-development/course-mapping-and-learning-objectives/writing-module-based-learning-objectives/) Instructional materials, assessments, and activities contribute to the achievement of learning outcomes and objectives. Instructional materials, assessments, activities, and activities should align with and be consistent with the course learning outcomes and the module learning objectives. Instructional materials include content within a course. Instructional materials may include, but are not limited to, textbook readings, articles, videos, podcasts, Open Educational Resources (OERs), publisher resources, and lecture notes. Assessments determine how well students are learning course content and meeting the goals of the course. It should be clear that assessments measure the achievement of learning outcomes/objectives. Assessments may include, but are not limited to, annotated bibliographies, blogs, critical reviews, digital storytelling, ePortfolios, essays, exams, field work, journals, online labs, literature reviews, peer reviews, presentations, projects, quizzes, reports, role play, self-assessments, and wikis. Consider including a variety of formative assessments to gauge student progress throughout the course.

      "Create Instructional Content - Center for Teaching Excellence | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Center for Teaching Excellence SC.edu About Offices and Divisions Center for Teaching Excellence Teaching Resources Adapting Courses for Changing Academic Needs Create Instructional Content Create Instructional Content Developing instructional content for a course depends on the delivery format and design of the course. It involves creation and development of assessment types, student activities, and associated instructional materials that achieve the course learning outcomes most effectively for the delivery format and goals of your course. CTE Instructional Designers can help you with making decisions about these materials based on best practices of assessment and student learning. Contact the CTE or the Instructional Design team(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/consultations/index.php) for a consult. Expand all Assessment Best Practices for Online Courses There are practical considerations you need to make regarding assessments, course management, and time based on the size of your class, discipline, and whether you have teaching assistant support for grading. The assessments you choose and the grade percentage you assign them indicate to your students what you want them to learn, so make sure your assessments are sending the right message. Assessments should connect to your course learning outcomes \u2013 the action verb you use will indicate what type of assessment you apply. An instructional designer can provide you options to help you select the assessment types best suited for these considerations, based on your course learning outcomes. Consider allowing students to submit assignments online in different ways: record a video of themselves discussing the answer, photo of their handwritten notes or work, etc. \u2013 numerous educational technology options exist for formative assessments and individual feedback. Low-stakes, Formative Assessment Strategies: Many formative assessments done in F2F settings are very adaptable for incorporating into the online environment. Small group activities, partner-work problem-solving, short answer responses, etc. can be done using tools in Blackboard (tests, assignments, discussion boards), online educational technologies and other assessment tools. These low-stakes assessment techniques can be included as or part of weekly quizzes or other low-stakes assessments, assignments, or group discussion summaries. Certain grading scales lend themselves to more efficient grading, especially for low-stakes assignments. For example, it can be easier to decide if a short in-class paper deserves a mark of \u201ccheck-plus\u201d or \u201ccheck-minus \" compared to determining whether it deserves a numerical or letter grade. Examples of good low stakes active learning strategies that can be modified for class assessments can be found in these websites: Active Learning Examples of Classroom Assessment Techniques for Classes(http://www.schreyerinstitute.psu.edu/pdf/2011-10-13-10430-CATs_for_Large_Classes.pdf) High-stake Tests and Summative Assessments: Organize tests and summative assessments in such a way to allow students multiple opportunities to learn and show mastery or evidence of progress throughout the term, and not just at the end of the semester. Writing test questions: Use Bloom\u2019s Taxonomy Table(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/docs/learning_outcomes_taxonomy_table.pdf) to help you craft multiple-choice questions that address the higher levels of application or learning you desire. Include case studies, problem sets whose questions build on each other with respect to thought processes and strategies. Test Pools and Test Builder: Create tests from Test Pools and use the Blackboard Test Builder to streamline and shorten your exam development time. Automatic grading: Blackboard has numerous functionalities for automatic grading and feedback options. Use Peer Review and Peer Assessments for Grading Students are perfectly capable of supplying feedback for each other. Peer review not only takes some of the pressure off you as being the sole feedback-giver, it also is a great formative learning experience for students and helps them more critically assess their own work. Peer review is an important and vital aspect of building community and enhancing social presence in online courses. With peer review, students are tasked to consider the amount, level, value, worth, quality or success of the products or outcomes of learning of peers of similar status (Topping, 1998). Peer review is a process where students communicate with one another and participate in dialogue related to performance and standards (Liu & Carless, 2006)."

The School Director is responsible for implementing the change. PROCEDURE : The initiator will present the recommendation for a new course or course change to the Curriculum Committee. Full documentation (i.e. description, hours, etc.) must accompany the proposal. The Curriculum Committee will consider the proposal and present a recommendation to the entire faculty at the next scheduled faculty meeting. Faculty may approve the proposal in which case the proposal will be forwarded to the School\u2019s Director who is responsible for sending to the appropriate University committee. Faculty may also disapprove the proposal or faculty may refer the proposal back to the Curriculum Committee for change and resubmission to the faculty. The Director is responsible for tracking curriculum changes at the University level and then seeing that those changes are implemented within the School. D Expand all Distinguished Alumni and Award for Service - D20 Date: April 25, 2003 Revised: December 15, 2008 POLICY: The School\u2019s Distinguished Alumni Awards were established to recognize former students of the School who have achieved significant recognition in the field of journalism and mass communications. The Dean and Director\u2019s Award for Service is to recognize contributions by Alumni to the School. PROCEDURE : The School has two Distinguished Alumni Awards. The Distinguished Alumnus Award is for graduates who have been out of school for more than 10 years and whose careers represent significant professional achievement. The Outstanding Young Alumnus award is for graduates who have been out of school 10 years or less but who have already demonstrated significant professional accomplishments early in their careers. Alumni selected for the awards are initially nominated by faculty or alumni of the School in the spring semester of the year of recognition. A two-thirds vote of the faculty is required for a nominee to be named a recipient of one of the awards. While anyone may nominate someone for the Dean and Director\u2019s Award for Service, the Director and Dean select the honoree. All three recipients are traditionally recognized at an event during Homecoming weekend.

PROCEDURE : During a crisis, the Director\u2019s Office (803 777-6791) will serve as the input point for receiving word of an emergency originating outside the building and will coordinate the response to any emergency that originates inside the building. Should an emergency occur during a normal business day when classes are in session, the Director\u2019s office will notify the dean, associate dean, directors and sequence heads in person or by telephone. Such individuals would physically move through the School\u2019s section of the Coliseum and alert students, staff and faculty. If an emergency requiring action to protect individuals or equipment or records originates outside normal business hours, the Dean and/or other top College/School official will alert appropriate personnel. Because the Coliseum serves as an authorized emergency shelter, the facility can be expected to attract people, both within and without the University community, to seek shelter. All would seek safety away from the windows on the academic level. Internal threats would normally require immediate evacuation via the nearest exit. Periodic fire drills coordinated by the Director and campus police should prepare students, faculty and staff for quick and orderly evacuation of the building. In the case of an internal threat of violence or criminal behavior, notification would be via telephones and e-mail, with only the Director, or his/her representative, moving through the building to alert students and staff. If the threat is deemed widespread, then students, staff and faculty will be advised to move to the nearest secure area with a communication device and wait out the threat. With the possibility of power outages, each faculty and staff office is equipped with a flashlight. Staff and faculty will be expected to monitor, and assist with, evacuation of the building during a power failure.

If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, a course change proposal must be submitted in APPS with the Carolina Core information completed. Integrative Course Proposals An Integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. As a result, regulatory oversight is ceded predominantly to the academic unit. A department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporates one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes such that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course. The following is the process to designate or delete an Integrative course. Add an Integrative Course Submit a new course proposal or course change proposal as appropriate in APPS.

Begin by talking with the head of your academic unit and also to the Academic Program Liaison (APL) in your college or school. The APL has experience with academic program actions and can provide guidance on how to develop your idea and take it through the entire University Faculty Senate approval process. Procedures and guidelines for proposing a new course or course change are available from the Office of Academic Programs . Note that the Carolina Core Approval Committee will evaluate the proposed course ensuring that it meets all student achievements for the Core learning outcome, the course is at the 100 or 200 level, the course is open to all students (although there can be pre- or co-requisites and major-specific sections), and that the courses is appropriate for the proposing academic unit to teach. To submit a Carolina Core course or course change for approval, individuals who have authority to submit proposals (who can be identified by the Academic Program or the APL) start a new proposal in Academic Programs Proposal System ( APPS(https://cas.auth.sc.edu/cas/login?service=https%3a%2f%2fuscbulletins-next.sc.edu%2fcourseadmin%2f) ).

      "How do I develop and/or seek approval for a Special Topics Education course? A course addressing a special topic of interest to educators may be developed and offered using the EDUC 632, 633, 634 or 635 numbers. These courses can carry between 1 and 3 credits. To propose a special topic course for approval, you will need to develop a syllabus addressing the topic and document the course experience consistent with the credit offered. The syllabus must include specific academic requirements and a method of evaluation that clearly explains how the final letter grade will be assessed as well as specific meeting days and times so a minimum of 700 minutes over one week of study is included for each credit offered (i.e. a 3-credit course must include a minimum of 2100 minutes of instruction over 3 weeks). Once the syllabus is finalized, complete the Special Topics Graduate Course Approval form found at the Provost Office's site.(https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/documents/index.php) If the course is a regular offering (not offered under a contract), submit to submit the Special Topics form to the Department Chair for review/approval. If the course is to be offered under contract to a client district or agency, submit to the Office of Educational Outreach which will secure Graduate School approval prior to initiating the course contract.

      "Steps to a Good Syllabus - Center for Teaching Excellence | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Center for Teaching Excellence SC.edu About Offices and Divisions Center for Teaching Excellence Teaching Resources Syllabus Templates Steps to a Good Syllabus Steps to a Good Syllabus Because students will view the syllabus as a kind of \"contract,\" it is important to be as clear as possible, and to avoid changing major aspects of the syllabus after the first day of class. In deciding what to include in the syllabus, first include all information that students need to have at the beginning of the course. Second, include all information that students need to have in writing. There is no hard-and-fast rule about the proper length for a syllabus. If in doubt, it is usually best to err on the long side, to ensure that important course information is fully covered. At the same time, students will appreciate having key information in succinct form on the first page. Expand all 1. Get Started Before you start writing your syllabus, think first and foremost about the knowledge and skills students should gain in your course, then about how you will assess these knowledge and skills, and finally about the best ways for the students to learn them. Focusing on learning outcomes, rather than a list of topics to cover, generally results in a more satisfying course for you and your students. Organize the syllabus logically, and use consistent (underlined or bold-faced headings) to help students find information. We recommended that the syllabus be created in three main parts: (1) Course Description, (2) Course Outline, and (3) Policies and Procedures. Creating each of these parts separately gives you a set of three documents that can be easily adapted or directly reused for other courses taught 2. The Course Overview Section The course description components of the syllabus should not be changed during the running of the course. A well constructed one or two page document is usually sufficient to include the following: The Course Title, Course Number, and Semester Instructor Contact Information Office Hours and Location Course Meeting Location and Times Course Description(http://bulletin.sc.edu/content.php?catoid=37&navoid=798) Learning Outcomes Required Textbooks or Readings 3. Course Requirements and Grading The course requirements and grading section should include the following: Assignments and/or exams with brief descriptions of expectations and values for each. Grading scheme and weights including what a student must do to receive a grade of A to F. Syllabi for courses at the 500 or 600 levels must contain an explanation of the differences in requirements for graduate and undergraduate credit. Graduate students should be required to complete additional graduate level work (e.g., a research paper and/or substantive additional reading), and should be evaluated on a more rigorous basis than undergraduate students. Topical outline of content to be covered A time allocation framework (e.g., week 1, week 2, etc. to include at least 14 weeks for a standard academic year course session) 4. The Course Outline Section The course outline is a part of the syllabus that may be subject to change as the semester progresses. For example, a topic students find more difficult than anticipated may require additional time, or weather conditions may cancel sessions. Changes should be kept to a minimum, be reasonable and justified, and notice provided in a timely manner. A course outline can be presented on a separate sheet or as a separate file online, and can include: Topics and Timeline Reading Assignments Due Dates for Assignments Test and Exam Dates Some instructors like to outline their course in a date-by-date list, others with a general list without reference to specific dates, and still others with a calendar style. Examples for these approaches can be found as Syllabus Templates. 5. The Policies and Procedures Section Course Expectations are policies and procedures that describe how you will treat students. What you include and how it is stated will influence your classroom\u2019s climate. It is therefore important not only to state what you expect of students, but to explain why. It is also recommended that you include a statement of what the students can expect from you. Since there is a good chance that your expectations of students will be the same in most of the classes you teach, it is a good idea to create your policies and procedures as a single document that you can reuse.",

Therefore, students must have access to the Internet to view/hear lectures. No special software is required. Students will also submit all assignments and take all quizzes/tests through Blackboard\"? Does the syllabus indicate the minimum student technical requirements/skills required by the course? Does the module outline demonstrate that students will be expected to expend approximately the same amount of total time and effort per credit hour as they would in a traditional face-to-face version of the course? (Note: for a traditional course the expectation is 700 minutes--14 hours--of classroom instruction with twice that amount--at least 28 hours--of supplementary academic work outside the classroom per each credit hour).

Integrative learning at USC is about making connections across within and beyond the classroom experiences and includes student engagement in community service, research, peer leadership, internships, and study abroad. Integrative learning is more than just having the experience though and also includes learning from the experience and connecting learning to academic study. The final step is applying learning to solve problems and make decisions . . . applying learning to lead. USC students\u2019 educational experiences are enriched by engagement within and beyond the classroom and their ability to connect these experiences is the heart of a truly meaningful education. CIEL promotes student opportunities to engage beyond the classroom and synthesize and apply learning across experiences. Graduation with Leadership Distinction is the Center\u2019s signature program and recognizes students for significant engagement and learning, including leadership through solution-oriented thinking. Experiential Learning is also encouraged for all undergraduate students. Mission To advance integrative and experiential learning across within and beyond the classroom experiences at the University of South Carolina Columbia and Palmetto College campuses for students, faculty, and staff by providing programs, developing resources, conducting outreach, and facilitating assessment. Vision To foster an enriched educational environment through purposeful within and beyond the classroom experiences that deepen the impact on student learning and enhance their preparation for the future.

      "Damien Picarello Charles Pierce, Associate Professor, Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering (ECIV 101: Introduction to Civil Engineering, ECIV 201: Computational Methods for Civil Engineering) Pierce\u2019s proposal aims to develop and implement the foundation for a programmatic Integrative Learning Plan (ILP) within the Department of Civil & Environmental Engineering (CEE) focusing primarily on the first two years of the curriculum. The goal of this proposal is to create a structured curricular approach for raising student awareness about purposeful involvement and integrative learning. The two proposed ILP courses are distinctly different from one another in terms of instructional content and delivery, making them good candidates for introducing integrative learning from two different perspectives. The plan will elevate and, hopefully, institutionalize student awareness of the GLD program. However, even if students choose not to pursue GLD or do not meet the GPA requirements, the ILP will expose all students to the value of pursuing meaningful extracurricular activities and reflecting on how these experiences are connected to their academic learning. Charles Pierce Susan Rathbun-Grubb, Assistant Professor, School of Library and Information Science (SLIS 735: Metadata, SUS 732: Indexing and Abstracting) SUS735- Metadata and SUS 732- lndexing and Abstracting require students to plan and design digital collections and to create and use taxonomies for information. While the courses assess the students' ability to plan for a system, the instructor was unable to adequately demonstrate, teach, or assess skills related to implementation and testing of the planned systems. A 16-month subscription to the Microsoft SharePoint content management system will allow the instructor to bridge the theory-practice divide by enabling students to practice implementation skills and to evaluate usability. Moreover, the system will enable students to make the vital connection between metadata design \"best practices\" and the demonstrable evidence of a real system that can be utilized and tested. The addition of a reflective portion to the assignments will also give students the opportunity to assess the effectiveness of their design decisions in a system they are very likely to encounter when they join the workforce as a professional. Susan Rathbun-Grubb Armen Shaomian, Assistant Professor, Department of Sport and Entertainment Management (SPTE 590: The Business of Broadway) This entirely new course designed to explore and understand the multibillion-dollar Broadway industry will focus on knowledge and skills that will assist students in promoting positive change in professional settings. As an integral part of the live-entertainment industry, this course will fill a large gap in the entertainment management portion of the Sport and Entertainment Management degree, not only by increasing students' knowledge and awareness of the business and management aspects of Broadway, but also channeling them into entertainment management careers through the benefit of their high-level of management expertise accrued in specific relation to this course. Shaomian intends for this course to be an exciting and new course option, using integrative learning methods for management students engaged in the USC Connect Graduation with Leadership Distinction (GLD) program. Students will be provided with unique insights into the creative and artistic world that translate across all managerial disciplines by including several peer leadership opportunities throughout the course. Armen Shaomian David Weintraub, Senior Instructor, School of Journalism and Mass Communications (JOUR 499-001: Freelancing for Creative Professionals) Weintraub\u2019s project will retool the existing special-topics course, Freelancing for Creative Professionals, into an elective course with a permanent place in the curriculum. The course examines the theory and practice of entrepreneurship as they apply to creative professionals. Students learn the skills and techniques necessary for starting and operating their own successful freelance business. An important component of the course is integrative learning, in this case exposing students to professionals working in creative fields through interviews with local entrepreneurs; sales pitches to actual clients; business proposals to clients or investors; guest speakers in the classroom, field visits to business run by local entrepreneurs, and Skype interviews with leading experts. The goal of this project is to retool both the course content and the instructional methods to provide students with an enriched integrative-learning experience.

What is Navigate? EAB Navigate is one of the four advising technologies used on the USC Columbia campus. It is heavily utilized as the primary scheduling platform for academic advising appointments, as well as for nearly two dozen student service offices around campus. The original platform is intended to guide the prioritization of outreach to and interaction with students based on risk levels and success marker flags. The success markers are established by each department based on the courses that are most predictive of success in each major over time using USC historic student data, or based on critical courses from major maps. These involve both threshold grades in key courses and the timing of those courses. Risk levels are based on student performance and characteristics relative to other students who have graduated in the particular major. Success markers, risk levels, and student characteristics (GPA ranges, class level, department, college, native/transfer, etc.) can be used to quickly query lists of students who may need further assistance. EAB Navigate for Scheduling - Academic Units The list below includes all colleges, departments, and advising units currently utilizing EAB Navigate for scheduling their appointments with students.

      "Members of ensembles are expected to be present at every rehearsal and performance unless excused. Regulations pertaining to jury examinations, ensemble participation, recitals, seminar attendance and other related matters are published in the School of Music\u2019s Handbook for Undergraduate Students . Progression Requirements Acceptance as a music major does not guarantee progression to the upper division. To remain in a degree program offered by the School of Music, a student must make satisfactory progress toward the degree. A student who fails to make satisfactory academic progress may be placed on academic probation or removed from the school. This includes satisfactory progress in the applied music sequence. In addition, all students in the school are subject to the regulations on probation, suspension, and readmission in the \u201cAcademic Standards\u201d section of the \u201cAcademic Regulations\u201d chapter of this bulletin. At the end of the sophomore year, each student\u2019s progress toward completion of lower-division requirements will be evaluated. Upper Division To be admitted to the upper division, students must meet the following criteria: completion of piano proficiency requirements; completion of the Aural Skills training sequence MUSC 117 , MUSC 118 , MUSC 217 , MUSC 218 ); Bachelor of Music with an emphasis in Theory majors must achieve a minimum grade of \u201c B \u201d completion of music theory sequence ( MUSC 115 , MUSC 215 ); Bachelor of Music with an emphasis in Theory majors must achieve a minimum grade of \u201c B \u201d for music education majors, completion of the Music Education Practicum ( MUED 200 ); for Bachelor of Music students, approval of the applied jury to progress to the upper-division courses (MUSC 311 or MUSC 411), as appropriate to the chosen degree program; completion of at least 60 credits with a cumulative grade point average of 2.50 in MUSC and MUED courses and 2.00 in all courses. Graduation In order to be eligible for graduation, students in the School of Music must meet all course requirements, be in good standing, have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.50 on all MUSC and MUED courses, and have a cumulative GPA of at least 2.00 on all work attempted at USC. The last 30 semester hours must be completed in residence at the University, and at least half of the hours in the student\u2019s major courses and in the student\u2019s minor courses must be taken at the University. For further information on this and other University regulations, see the \u201cAcademic Regulations\u201d chapter of this bulletin. Advisement Every music major will be assigned an advisor in the school, who will consult with the student throughout the college career. Students must see their academic advisors at least once each semester for assistance in planning their academic program. No student will be allowed to complete the registration process without an advisement form approved by an assigned faculty advisor. It is the responsibility of each student to understand and complete all degree requirements. The student\u2019s major advisor is responsible for interpreting and applying major, minor, and cognate requirements. When special problems arise, the student may consult the director of undergraduate studies. Right of Petition A student may seek relief from academic standards and regulations by appealing to the Scholastic Standards and Petitions Committee of the School of Music. Information on procedures may be obtained from the music studies office. Career Development The School of Music aims to complement academic advising by assisting music students in clarifying career directions. Students are encouraged to begin the process of career planning as early as possible. Career counselors are available in the University Career Center to assist students in gaining an understanding of their own interests, values, abilities, and personalities, the nature of a liberal arts education and the related marketable skills, and the numerous career opportunities available for music majors. In addition, students are encouraged to complement their academic studies with career-related work experience such as internships, cooperative education, part-time work experience, or volunteer work. Special Opportunities Performance Certificate The performance certificate is awarded by the School of Music to recognize those undergraduate music students with degree emphases other than music performance as well as those students not majoring in music. The performance certificate will allow gifted and highly motivated students to acquire additional credit, professorial interaction and guidance, and departmental distinction in music performance. Incoming freshman may demonstrate their fitness for the performance certificate during their qualifying or scholarship audition. Continuing students are eligible to enter this program by application to the coordinator of the appropriate area faculty and upon recommendation of the area faculty jury. The course of study for the certificate includes applied music registration for MUSC 211 (for 3 credits each semester) and a minimum of two semesters of MUSC 411 (for 3 credits each semester)."

What Makes up my Program of Study? In the College of Arts and Sciences, your program of study consists of the following requirements: Carolina Core, College Requirements, Electives, Program courses, Major courses, and either a Minor or Cognate. CAS programs require between 120 to 128 credit hours to graduate, depending upon your major. Learn more about the requirements below. Carolina Core The Carolina Core(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/) is a set of requirements that students across the University of South Carolina have to complete as part of their program of study. The Carolina Core is made up of 10 core components, each with a learning outcome and credit hour requirements. Click below on each requirement to learn more. You can find the entire list of Carolina Core applicable courses, as well as the requirements that they fulfill in the most recent academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/carolina-core-courses/#foundationalcoursestext) . College Requirements The College Requirements are different from the Carolina Core, in that they are only required for the specific college in which you are studying. While looking at the separate components of the Carolina Core above, you may have noticed that there is some overlap between Carolina Core and College Requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences. Click on each College Requirement below to learn more. For more information on the College Requirements, follow the link to the College of Arts and Sciences College Requirements on the academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/arts-sciences/#text) .

The Founding Documents requirement is the only other place in your program of study besides the overlay, where one course can fulfill two requirements. Talk to your advisor about how to make the most out of the classes you take! Foreign Language As stated in the GFL section of the Carolina Core, as a CAS student, you will need to reach the 122 level of foreign language of your choice. How many hours of foreign language you will have to take is dependent on your Foreign Language Placement Test(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) score. You must register in advance to take this Placement test. Once you have your score, your advisor will help you register(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) for the appropriate foreign language class. Social Science As part of the CAS College Requirements, you will need one GSS Carolina Core and an additional Social Sciences class. While any of the GSS courses can apply towards this requirement, you can always ask your advisor for a list of applicable courses. U.S. History/Non-U.S. History The College of Arts and Sciences requires you to take both a US History class, as well as a Non-U.S. History class.

For a new course submitted in APPS, complete the Carolina Core information. If adding the Carolina Core designation to an existing course, a course change proposal must be submitted in APPS with the Carolina Core information completed. Integrative Course Proposals An Integrative course is an upper division course that includes one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core. The purpose of this course is to ensure that learning outcomes from the Core are integrated into higher level classes in the major. This process is based on the original intent of integrative courses from the 10-06-2010 Faculty Senate meeting which gave individual academic programs the leeway to design these courses as they see fit. The intent of these courses is to facilitate awareness and attention to some of the Core foundational skills or knowledge being threaded up through the curriculum. As a result, regulatory oversight is ceded predominantly to the academic unit. A department must identify one or more upper-level major courses that incorporates one or more of the Carolina Core learning outcomes such that every student in that major will take at least one integrative course. The following is the process to designate or delete an Integrative course. Add an Integrative Course Submit a new course proposal or course change proposal as appropriate in APPS. In the justification section, provide the following information: Carolina Core Integrative Course, Major Name, Degree (e.g., ANTH 444, Anthropology, B.S.) and explain which Carolina Core Learning outcomes(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/faculty-and-staff/learning-outcomes.php) are met by the course and how the course meets the Carolina Core Learning outcome(s). No syllabus is required. Delete an Integrative Course For deletions of only the Integrative Course designation (not the whole course), submit a course change proposal in APPS and state in the justification that the Integrative Course designation is being deleted. Upon Approval in Faculty Senate, the Integrative Course will be scribed into Degree Works. The Office of Academic Programs will also report the information to the Office of the Provost to ensure that the Carolina Core website is updated and the records in the Office of the Provost are updated."

      "Have corresponding program changes been submitted? Do the pre-/co-requisite changes involve another department/program? If so, has a letter of concurrence been submitted? Variable Credit Hours? If the course hours are variable: Are maximum and minimum credit hours specified? Is a grading scale and assignments for each credit hour provided? For example, if the course is offered for 1-3 credits, a grading scale and assignments must be provided for 1 credit, 2 credits, and 3 credits. Is the number of times this course may be taken for credit greater than 1? (The statement is asking how many times it can be counted on the transcript as part of the program of study--not whether it can be repeated if failed. Only special topics courses or possibly internships should have a number greater than 1. Is this one of those?) Course Proposals Requiring Syllabi New courses (including new cross-lists) and courses that involves a significant change in course description, a change in Carolina Core or GLD designation, or a change in delivery mode to >50% online require a file syllabus. The following checklist items apply. Designator, Title, Course Info Does the course title in the proposal match that in the syllabus? Does the syllabus indicate the instructors' name as well as course meting days, times, and location (or equivalent)? Does the bulletin description in the proposal match that in the syllabus? Pre- or Co-requisites Are the pre/co-requisites included in the syllabus and do they match those in/proposed for the bulletin? Special Topics and Independent Studies These course are often variable credit and can be taken multiple times. The proposal should include the range of hours, number of times the course can be taken for credit and the maximum number of credit hours that can be applied to the degree. The Number of times the course can be taken for credit is not how many attempts a student can have to pass the course, but is how many times it can be taken, usually under different topics or studies. Example: Credit hours minimum for a single offering is 1. Credit hours maximum for a single offering is 6. Number of times the course can be taken is 6. Number of credit hours if course can be taken multiple times is 12. Is this all correct in the proposal? Learning Outcomes Does the syllabus include \"Learning Outcomes\" and use that exact phrase (as opposed to \"Learning Objectives\" etc.)? Do the Learning Outcome describe significant and essential learning that students will achieve and can reliably demonstrate at the end of a course, e.g., \"By the end of the course, students will: ....\"? Do the statements follow best-practices, particularly with respect to action verbs that identify quantifiable or measurable actions? See https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/coursedevelopment/learning_outcomes/(https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/cte/teaching_resources/course_design_development_delivery/learning_outcomes/index.php) and www.apu.edu/live_data/files/333/blooms_taxonomy_action_verbs.pdf(http://www.apu.edu/live_data/files/333/blooms_taxonomy_action_verbs.pdf) If this is a 500/600 level course is there at least one learning outcome specific to graduate students? This should connect to an assignment specific to graduate students. Caroline Core Course? If this is a Carolina Core Course: Does the proposal specify one or more learning outcomes from the Carolina Core? If this is proposed as an overlay course, does it include at least one learning outcome from CMS, INF, or VSR? Is the offering colleges/department expert in the content pertaining to the learning outcome? If course content potentially overlaps with content offered by another program, has a letter of concurrence been provided? Policy Statements Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding academic integrity? Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding attendance policy? Does the syllabus include a suitable statement regarding students with disabilities? Evaluation Does this syllabus specify assignments, projects, quizzes, and/or exams with brief descriptions of expectations and points/weights assigned to each activity? Does the syllabus clearly indicate the grading scale, weight of each assignment (points or percentage), and how grades will be assigned? If standard grades are used, does the syllabus indicate how letters A-F will be assigned (by points or percentage)?"

      "), the initiator creates a syllabus in compliance with university syllabus guidelines and completes the necessary CIC forms for processing. The iSchool Curriculum Committee reviews the proposal and presents a recommendation to the entire faculty at the next scheduled faculty meeting. Special faculty meetings (in person or virtual) may be called for the purpose of an expedited vote when university due dates are incompatible with regularly scheduled Faculty Meetings. Faculty may approve the proposal in which case it will move forward to the appropriate Faculty Senate (undergraduate) or Graduate Council (graduate) committee. Faculty may also disapprove the proposal and refer it back to the initiator for revision. Proposal Components All proposals require a completed syllabus aligning with InDev requirements and all other university policy items (learning outcomes, required textbook, student support, disability, academic integrity, etc.) If the proposal is for a new permanent course, please contact the Chair of the Curriculum Committee for an appropriate new course number. Changes to courses must take into consideration any prerequisites/corequisites/cross listings, and other requirements of the course undergoing revision. Once the Curriculum Committee approves the proposal packet, the proposal will be forwarded for iSchool faculty approval. After the iSchool faculty approves the proposal, the proposal will be forwarded to the CIC Associate Dean for Academic Affairs for submission via the U of SC App system. O Expand all Office Assignments Date: 8/25/81; Revised: 10/4/16; 2/9/2024 POLICY When space becomes available the director shall determine if the space shall be used for faculty offices or some other purpose (research space, staff functions, etc.) based on the needs of the School. When appropriate, the Director will consult with faculty on space decisions. Upon determining that a space is to be used for faculty offices, the director shall offer it first to the most senior member of the faculty by rank and time on faculty. This process continues, working down the list of eligible faculty, until all spaces are assigned. Note that a change in rank or seniority does not guarantee a choice of a new office. New office assignments come only upon availability through retirements, new space openings, etc. Office Hours Date: 4/18/86; Reviewed: 4/15/09; 2/9/2024 POLICY Instructional staff members should post a reasonable number of convenient office hours, as determined administratively, with the option of appointments . Office hours may be held in person or virtually. Faculty will post office hours in Blackboard and on syllabi. Faculty should also be available by appointment to accommodate students\u2019 schedules. P Expand all Peer Review, Faculty Date: 4/15/09; Reviewed 05/08/24 POLICY Peer review of teaching is a process mandated by the University as part of the requirements of performance funding, tenure, and promotion. The purpose of peer review is to improve the quality of teaching in a department or college. Peer review of teaching is to be considered in the annual evaluation process conducted by the iSchool Tenure and Promotion Committee and by the Director. Peer review will also be considered in the evaluation process that takes place at the time a faculty member submits his or her file for tenure or promotion. PROCEDURE A. All faculty, tenured and non-tenured, will be reviewed as follows: Tenured: Once in the year before post-tenure review Non-Tenured, Tenure-track: Once per year Professional track, adjunct, & part-time: According to the review policies for Professional track faculty and to the school guidelines for adjunct and part-time. Any faculty member may request an annual peer review. B. Each September the Chair of the iSchool Tenure and Promotion Committee will: Identify the tenure track and tenured faculty members to be reviewed that academic year. Appoint one reviewer for each identified faculty member to be reviewed. Reviewers must be members of the iSchool Tenure and Promotion Committee. The iSchool Tenure and Promotion Committee Chair will notify reviewers and faculty to be reviewed of the appointments made. C. Review Process The instructor selects at least one typical face-to-face or online class or module for review. This should include a normal, for that course, array of events, and not be especially orchestrated for review. The instructor and appointed reviewer will agree upon the time for the visit."

    "response": "Based on the provided context, if your proposal is an institutional grant requiring a budget and a University of South Carolina (USC) authorized signature, it will need approval through USCeRA. However, the context does not specify whether external approvals are necessary. If you're unsure, we recommend checking with your Sponsored Awards Management (SAM) representative or the sponsor for clarification.",

      "If another university is lead, you must submit a budget, scope of work, etc., to USCeRA for approval. USC will be listed as a subaward and receive a contract if awarded. You can\u2019t receive direct compensation from an external source for work related to your position/research at USC unless you receive prior approval. ALL EXTERNAL PROPOSALS MUST GO THROUGH USCeRA. Only SAM can submit proposals. Also, faculty must report outside activities and financial interests yearly, so disclosures alert for potential conflicts. Note USC\u2019s Outside Professional Activities for Faculty Policy # ACAF 1.50 before entering into any agreement. If you have questions regarding that policy, please see Rachel Rolli. If you have other questions related to specific grants and USCeRA, please ask Terri. She is our liaison to SAM. What if I do not have time to submit through USCeRA? There are very rare occasions when SAM will permit the PI to submit to the sponsor as long as the proposal has been reviewed by Terri, the Dean, and the Director. There is no guarantee this will be permitted by SAM. SAM requires a minimum of three business days for review and submission. If there is a potential problem meeting the deadline, Terri will alert SAM for guidance. I am listed as a co-PI on a grant. How do I get recognition and associated IDC for my portion of the award? SAM can create separate accounts to distribute funds awarded outside our college and schools. If you are included in a sponsored project with another department, the lead PI should request a separate subaccount when submitting the proposal to USCeRA. If awarded, a subaccount will be created with your budget, IDC, and revenue (if any). We recommend subaccounts for all awards now. If you are collaborating with another university or entity outside USC, please ask to be listed as a subrecipient. How are faculty compensated for work on a grant? Depending on sponsor guidelines, faculty can choose summer compensation and/or a course buyout. The buyout rate is 12.5% of faculty salary + fringe + health. Buyouts must be approved by the school director and the dean (typically one course buyout per year is allowed, or two in rare exceptions). Who do I go to if I have questions about the grant process? Terri should be your first contact if/when you are working on a grant. Terri will work closely with SAM. If you would like assistance in reviewing the content of your grant proposal (the idea, the writing, etc.), please reach out to the Associate Dean of Research. Time permitting, Linwan will be happy to review proposals and/or she might be able to solicit feedback from the school directors and/or other experts in your area of research. Where can I go to search for grant opportunities? Terri routinely searches for funding opportunities for the college. Faculty are also encouraged to search for funding. Two external and two internal sites for funding are listed below: Federal grants(https://www.grants.gov/) Pivot(https://pivot.proquest.com/) (Offers the ability to sign up for email alerts) Internal Funding and Awards USC internal grants What is the difference between direct and indirect costs? Get detailed information on direct and indirect costs here What if I have an idea for research or other programming or scholarship that would require funding, but would need collaborators or other help? Please notify Terri(https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/cic/faculty-staff/moorer_terri.php) and Linwan(https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/cic/faculty-staff/wu_linwan.php) about your idea. They can help you search for possible grant funders and/or help you find collaborators who might be able to help pursue your goals. I received an award. What are my duties as PI? It varies by grant, but typically the Principal Investigator: Is responsible for all actions required to manage and complete the scientific and programmatic aspects of the sponsored project. Initiates the hiring or assignment process and approves the selection or appointment of individuals to the project and is responsible for communicating staff changes to departmental administrative staff. Ensures the integrity and safeguarding of data. Ensures the completion, accuracy and timeliness of reports.

      "Q & A - My Arnold School | University of South Carolina Skip to Content My Arnold School SC.edu Study Colleges and Schools My Arnold School Faculty & Staff Administrative Departments Office of Research Research Support Q & A Q & A PRE-AWARD USCeRA Expand all Does this proposal need to go through USCeRA for approval? If you answer YES to any of the following, it needs approval through USCeRA. Is this an institutional grant? Does it require a budget? Does it need a University of South Carolina (USC) Authorized Signature? When is my proposal due in USCeRA and the submission software? Arnold School of Public Health (ASPH) requires completed proposals to be entered in USCeRA and the submission software of your choice 7 business days before the sponsor\u2019s or submitting institution\u2019s deadline. Example: If your proposal is due to the sponsor on Friday at 5 p.m., you must submit a completed, ready-to-review proposal to USC by 5 p.m. on Wednesday the week before. What is due to the Office of Research (OoR) 7 business days before the sponsor deadline? To comply, a completed proposal must be loaded in USCeRA, and the submission software must be ready for review. A PI may still tweak the Aims and Research Strategy sections during review, but all other areas of the proposal must be complete. Can I work on my research strategy and aims pages during the 7-day review? Yes, you can continue working on these up until submission. I am collaborating with another institution, and I am the PI (USC is the primary submitter) on the project. What steps and forms/files does the institution need to provide in USCeRA? In USCeRA, while completing the PAP (Proposal/Award Processing form), answer the collaboration questions under the \u201cFunding\u201d section. Then, under the \u201cQuestions\u201d section (last section), click yes to question number 5 (Sole source considerations: subcontracts, outside consultants, equipment?) and complete the sole source certification that will pop up under \u201cMy Forms\u201d after the PAP form is completed. NOTE: complete ONE certification for EACH collaborating institution (i.e., 3 collaborating institutions = 3 certification forms). Click the \u201cAdd Certification\u201d button under the tools section for additional certifications. Upload the following forms for each subaward: Please ask subawards to return paperwork 1 week before the USCeRA deadline. CSOW (scope of work) Budget Budget justification Letter of intent/collaboration approved by the SAM (Sponsored Awards Management) equivalent representative for the institution USC Subrecipient commitment form Additional information for NIH (National Institutes of Health) submissions: Facilities document Biosketches Equipment, if applicable Performance site LOI (Letter of Intent) from PI (per solicitation) LOI from consultant (per application) that reflects SOW, the time frame, and the fee When is my proposal due in USCeRA if I am a subcontract to another institution? Your proposal is due in USCeRA 7 business days before the institution has requested your paperwork. Please use the prime institution\u2019s deadline in USCeRA instead of the main sponsor\u2019s deadline. I am collaborating with another institution, and I am the co-I or co-PI (USC is a subaward) on the project. What forms/files do I need to upload in USCeRA? Scope of work (a description of USC\u2019s portion of work in the project; be specific). Budget and budget justification (ask the collaborator if the institution requires specific forms). Any other required forms from the collaborating institution. SAM representative will write the letter of intent/collaboration. In the comment section, add contact information and how the documents are being submitted once approved. Can I change my budget after it goes through USCeRA? You can change the budget, but it will then have to be routed again for signatures. All documents must be in final form in USCeRA and for the submission application at the time of routing for approvals. Rerouting a proposal with revisions not requested by ASPH OoR or SAM resets the 7-business-day deadline. Do I need a waiver in USCeRA if I am using a different IDC (Indirect Cost) rate than the current rates above? Yes.",
      "USCeRA FAQs for PIs and Unit Approvers - My Arts and Sciences | University of South Carolina Skip to Content My Arts and Sciences SC.edu Study Colleges and Schools My Arts and Sciences For Faculty and Staff Administration and Departments Grants Operations USCeRA FAQs for PIs and Unit Approvers USCeRA FAQs for PIs and Unit Approvers USCeRA is the university\u2019s electronic research administration system. Faculty create and submit proposals through USCeRA to get unit head\u2019s and dean\u2019s office approval of proposal submissions prior to review by the Sponsored Awards Management (SAM) office. SAM office approval is required for all proposals. For general user instructions, please visit the SAM\u2019s user guide(http://sam.research.sc.edu/pdf/USCERA_Userguide.pdf) . PDF version of FAQs [pdf] FAQs for CAS Proposal Principal Investigators (PIs) 1. When should I create a new proposal in USCeRA? As soon as you know you\u2019ll be submitting an external proposal, you can create and save a new proposal in USCeRA. The approval process should be complete at least three days before the sponsor\u2019s due date. This allows a couple of business days for your unit head and dean\u2019s office to review \u2013 if they have questions, they may send the proposal back to you for corrections. We recommend submitting in USCERA as early as possible. A member of the CAS Grants team can help you complete the USCERA forms \u2013 email casgrant@mailbox.sc.edu for assistance. 2. What attachments are required for a USCeRA proposal to be considered ready for submission into the approval stage? At a minimum, you need to attach 1) a budget; 2) budget justification; and 3) project summary or abstract. If you have a subaward, you need to attach their budget, budget justification, statement of work, institutional letter of commitment, and subrecipient commitment form (new SAM requirement, template here). You should consider allowing some extra review time when your project involves subawards \u2013 if you or a member of the CAS Grants team identifies issues with the information submitted, this will allow time to work with the subawardee to make revisions before USCERA submission. If your proposal requires additional forms/templates that your SAM representative will need to review or sign in advance of submission, also attach those here (e.g. a sponsor-specific financial questionnaire). 3. I am submitting a Letter of Intent, not a full proposal \u2013 do I need to submit a proposal in USCeRA? Generally, letters of intent don\u2019t require a budget component, so a USCERA submission isn\u2019t required. Contact your SAM representative if you\u2019re unsure. 4. In the USCERA form titled Personnel and Effort Expended on the Project, what should I include? Enter the effort in months (or percentages) for key personnel for the first year of the project. The salary entry should match the amount requested for the corresponding person for the first year of the project. 5. I am applying for a Fellowship for faculty \u2013 if selected, the fellowship will be paid directly to me \u2013 do I need to submit a proposal in USCeRA? Yes. Fellowship applications often raise numerous issues; in particular, when the fellowship requires the applicant to spend time away from campus. Issues, including salary, benefits, and teaching relief, often come up and need to be addressed before work on the fellowship proposal is started. It is strongly advised that you have a discussion with your department chair/school director and the associate dean for research when considering a fellowship application. Fellowships that require the faculty member to teach at another institution will not be supported by the college. 6. The fellowship I\u2019m applying for is for a fixed amount, do I still need to include a budget in USCERA? Yes. The level of support provided by a particular fellowship is often set by the funding agency, but a budget and budget justification must still be uploaded in USCERA. The budget may be short and simply state that the amount requested is set by the funding agency. The budget justification should address how this money will be used \u2013 for salary, for travel, for course buyouts, etc. Any potential co-funding from the department or college should have been discussed prior to submission in USCERA as well as indicated in the comments section of Proposal/Award Processing form. 7. How do I know what indirect cost rate to apply?"

      "Finals Tips: How to ace your finals - USC News & Events | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Finals Tips: How to ace your finals Posted on: November 24, 2021; Updated on: November 24, 2021 By Cam Adams, stucomm@mailbox.sc.edu With finals just around the corner, you may be feeling a bit stressed. Lauren Brown of the Student Success Center has helped us put together a list of tips to guide you through the most stressful time of the year. Come up with a study plan Before hitting the books, you need to know what to expect for the exam. When and where are your exams? Are your exams cumulative or do they cover the last few weeks? What is the format of your exam? Knowing this information can help you determine how you need to study for each exam and when you need to start studying for each exam. It\u2019s recommended that students spread their studying out seven days before their exam. Brown also advises that students break their studying up into \u201cchunks\u201d within that week. For each chunk, determine what you want to cover, what your study strategy will be and the amount of time you\u2019ll need. Once you get to the day before the exam, you should do a general review of the material with a focus on your weakest areas. Lastly, study smarter, not harder. Once you get back from Thanksgiving break, you should start to implement your study plan. Use campus resources Another way to study effectively for finals is to make use of campus resources. The Student Success Center can be your go-to for all of your finals needs. In partnership with Russell House, the center will be hosting over 50 two-hour finals review sessions starting Dec. 4 and running through the remainder of finals week. Students can also drop into Russell House for tutoring between Dec. 1 and 4, and schedule one-on-one appointments on the Mezzanine level of the Thomas Cooper Library beginning Dec. 6. More info on these resources can be found on the student success center website . Remember to take care of yourself Although finals week is a very important time of the semester, it\u2019s also important to take care of yourself and prioritize your mental health. Remember to take periodic breaks throughout your study time as it allows your mind to reset. It is also important to remember to get a good night\u2019s sleep, giving your brain the rest it needs to ace your finals. Share this Story!

It is part of our campus license that includes Office Pro Plus and Office online like Word, Excel, PowerPoint, and OneNote. How to Video \u00bb(https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZZwmxUgSfZM) Why should I use OneDrive for Business instead of a different cloud document storage product such as DropBox or Google Docs? OneDrive for Business is covered by a Business Associates Agreement (BAA) and ensures the data is only stored in the continental United States as well as encrypted in transit and while stored. In other words, you can store FERPA, HIPAA and other forms of documents with PII data there safely. UTS centrally supports OneDrive for Business for cloud file storage and collaboration. What is the difference between OneDrive for Business and OneDrive? \u200b\u200bOneDrive for Business is administered by University Technology Services, and it\u2019s usage is covered under our enterprise license with Microsoft for faculty, staff and students. OneDrive is a consumer service provided and administered by Microsoft and is not covered under any contracts with USC. Faculty, staff, and students should use OneDrive for Business accessible through Office 365 for USC related documents. If you have a personal OneDrive account, it cannot be merged with your OneDrive for Business account, but you can still use both separately. Note: Personal OneDrive is not covered under our BAA, is not encrypted and has less storage. How can I use OneDrive for Business to collaborate? Create, upload, and share documents and folders with your colleagues and allow them to view, edit those documents or create new documents. You can also edit them at the same time in the web browser by using the online office products. OneDrive for Business will scan each document before uploading it to verify that it is not a known virus or malware distributor. Our current storage limits are set at 5 TB per user. OneDrive for Business is a recommended solution that has been vetted and security hardened for the protection of university data. However, the use of OneDrive for Business is not mandatory for university students, faculty, or staff. Is data stored in OneDrive for Business backed up? Microsoft periodically backs up data stored in OneDrive for Business for disaster recovery purposes only. OneDrive for Business offers a self-restore Recycling Bin where you can restore deleted items for up to 90 days from the date of deletion.",

      "Graduate Assistantship All full-time M.P.H. students are encouraged to work as graduate assistants in health service organizations in the community to acquire work experience and enrich the learning process through on-the-job application of concepts and techniques learned in the classroom. To qualify for an assistantship, a student must be fully admitted to a degree program, be enrolled as a full-time student, and maintain a 3.00 GPA. Dual Degrees The Department of Health Services Policy and Management and the College of Social Work, and Department of Political Science offer coordinated programs that lead to a dual degree. The requirements for the M.P.H. portion of each dual degree program are the same as shown above. The M.P.A. and M.S.W. portions of the dual degree programs are determined by the respective schools and college. Some courses do fulfill requirements for both portions of the dual degree. A dual degree program thus typically requires fewer semester hours in total than if the two programs were taken separately. Close this window Print Options Send Page to Printer Print this page.

      "Accelerated Graduate Programs - Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing SC.edu Study Colleges and Schools Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing Academics Accelerated Graduate Programs Accelerated Graduate Programs All graduate certificate, master's and Ph.D. programs in the Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing are available through the Accelerated Bachelor\u2019s/Graduate Study Plan. Qualified students can take courses that count toward both undergraduate and graduate degrees, reducing the time and cost to earn the graduate degree. How does it work? Qualified undergraduate students can earn up to 12 credit hours of graduate-level classes while still an undergraduate through the Accelerated Bachelor\u2019s/Graduate Study Plan. Here's how it works: Classes must be 500-level and above Classes must be taken for graduate credit through the application process described below Classes can be applied to your baccalaureate program and, with graduate program admission and approval, applied to your graduate program of study The use of dual credit can reduce the total time to earn both the undergraduate and graduate degrees. You can also use your undergraduate financial aid to pay for the dual credit courses. What graduate programs are available? While our five-year bachelor\u2019s/master\u2019s programs of study are popular, all of our graduate certificates, master\u2019s degrees and Ph.D. programs are eligible for inclusion in an Accelerated Bachelor\u2019s/Graduate Study Plan. For specifics on our offerings, visit our Graduate Programs page. Who is eligible? You will need to have earned at least 90 hours of undergraduate coursework and have a minimum GPA of 3.4 to formally apply for this program. However, we encourage engineering and computing students to start planning, with your advisor\u2019s help, before your junior year. Note that you don\u2019t need to be pursuing an undergraduate degree from the Molinaroli College of Engineering and Computing to start in one of our accelerated graduate programs. Of course, classes taken for dual credit must be degree-applicable for both your undergraduate degree and your intended graduate program of study. When both are in the same or similar discipline, it is easy to earn up to 12 hours of dual credit. We want you to be able to earn as much dual credit as possible, so please discuss the Accelerated Bachelor\u2019s/Graduate Study Plan with your advisor prior to taking your engineering, computing and technical electives and other 500-level classes that may be available for dual credit. You need to initially register for such classes for graduate credit for them to count, as graduate credit cannot be awarded retroactively. How do I apply? You will need to submit an initial application before registering for your first class in this program, and then again prior to each semester that you want to earn dual credit for a class. It is not complicated. Just follow the instructions on the Accelerated Bachelor\u2019s/Graduate Study Plan (G-ABGSP) form in the Graduate School\u2019s Forms Library(https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/graduate_school/graduate-studies/forms_library/index.php) . How is this different than Senior Privilege? Senior Privilege permits undergraduate seniors in their final semester (who need less than a normal course load to complete their baccalaureate requirements) to take up to six hours of graduate classes. Senior privilege classes are added to the undergraduate transcript but do not carry undergraduate credit or undergraduate GPA . Students cannot participate in both Senior Privilege and the Accelerated Bachelor\u2019s/Graduate Study Plan. For additional information, see the Senior Privilege (GS-19) form in the Graduate School\u2019s Forms Library(https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/graduate_school/graduate-studies/forms_library/index.php) .

      "How will the SCHC help me with my future plans? Honors classes go in depth to help students become more knowledgeable in their discipline, or pursue new topics they had not considered before. Small class sizes foster relationships with faculty who may turn into life-long mentors. Opportunities such as internships, research and service learning provide opportunities to apply your curriculum in hands-on settings, allowing you to prepare you for your future career and distinguish yourself as you pursue jobs or further education. Between our 36+ professional staff members and our Honors alumni network of over 10,000 graduates, you\u2019ll have a great support system in the Honors College! Will I receive honors credit for my AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses? Most of our students earn college credit before graduating from high school. Credits earned via AP/IB/Cambridge tests or dual-enrollment are not counted toward honors requirements, but they do count towards the Carolina Core, as appropriate(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/undergraduate_admissions/requirements/for_freshmen/ap_ib_credits/) . These credits often serve as pre-requisites for upper-level courses and can allow room in your course of study for higher-level courses. You can discuss your options with your advisor. Why don't you accept AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses for Honors? The premise of an AP/IB or dual-enrollment course is that it is equivalent to a college course. They are not designed as Honors College courses. This is a common practice amongst honors colleges and programs across the country. How do students apply their AP/IB or dual-enrollment courses as Honors students? There are many ways! These credits often apply towards Carolina Core requirements, allowing students more flexibility in their schedule to take exploratory seminar classes. It is not uncommon for Honors students to double major or add a minor with room in their schedule due to credits earned in high school. Students may also choose to shorten their time in undergraduate studies by graduating early or taking graduate level coursework as a senior. Given the rigor of the Honors requirements, however, we do not generally see students graduate with honors in two or fewer years. All of these options can be tailored to your needs and discussed in-depth with your advisor. How are Honors students involved at USC? It is up to each student how much they want to get involved, but Honors students tend to do a lot outside the classroom, holding nearly 30% of leadership positions on campus, despite being about 8% of the undergraduate population. They are involved in band, Greek life, athletics, student government, community service and much more! Honors is full of motivated students and being in Honors will not prevent you from taking advantage of all the opportunities at the University of South Carolina. Have more questions? Ask an Honors student \u2026 Meet our Honors Ambassadors! Honors Ambassadors are a diverse group of involved students who exemplify Honors College qualities of leadership, service, scholarship and global citizenship. They are driven intellectuals with diverse backgrounds, experiences and passions. They have won national awards, interned with Fortune 500 companies and participated in cutting-edge research. But they have also been known to sleep through their alarms and run late for class... and they love to answer questions about life at the Honors College!

Supervisors and HR Contacts The following template can be used for informal or formal requests for workplace accommodations. For formal requests, please wait to send the approval letter until you receive confirmation from the Employee Relations Office. Workplace Accommodation Approval Template [docx] If you are considering the denial of a workplace accommodation, please contact the Employee Relations Office by emailing uscer@mailbox.sc.edu or calling 803-777-3821. Frequently Asked Questions Expand all Do I have to submit my confidential health information to my supervisor or my department or division\u2019s HR contact if I feel uncomfortable doing so? No. You can send your request for workplace accommodations directly to the Division of Human Resources' Employee Relations Office. Please contact our office by emailing uscer@mailbox.sc.edu or calling 803-777-3821. The Employee Relations Office does not share your confidential health condition/status with outside parties. We only discuss requested or proposed accommodations with appropriate representatives from your department/division, such as your supervisor or HR Contact. The purpose of these discussions is to determine whether requested or proposed accommodations can be provided to allow you to perform the essential functions of your position without creating an undue hardship on your department/division or the university. Is my employer required to implement my first preference for an accommodation? Not necessarily. Employers must offer effective accommodations, which may or may not be the employee\u2019s first choice or preference for an accommodation. The appropriateness of an accommodation must be analyzed in its specific context through an interactive process between the employer and the employee. If you have questions or concerns regarding an accommodation that has or has not been provided to you, please contact the Employee Relations Office by emailing uscer@mailbox.sc.edu or calling 803-777-3821. What are the nondiscrimination requirements of the ADA, as amended? The ADA prohibits discrimination in all employment practices, including job application procedures, hiring, firing, advancement, compensation, training, and other terms, conditions, and privileges of employment. It applies to recruitment, advertising, tenure, layoff, leave, fringe benefits, and all other employment-related activities. If you have questions or concerns regarding an accommodation that has or has not been provided to you, please contact the Employee Relations Office by emailing uscer@mailbox.sc.edu or calling 803-777-3821. If you feel that you have been subjected to unlawful discrimination or harassment related to a disability, please contact the Office of Equal Opportunity Programs (by calling 803-777-3854 or emailing eop@mailbox.sc.edu . You may also file a complaint online(https://cm.maxient.com/reportingform.php?UnivofSouthCarolinaEOP&layout_id=40.) . Who is protected against employment discrimination by the ADA, as amended? Employment discrimination is prohibited against \"qualified individuals with disabilities.\" Persons discriminated against because they have a known association or relationship with a disabled individual are also protected. The ADA defines an \"individual with a disability\" as a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities or bodily functions, has a record of such an impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment. The first part of the definition makes clear that the ADA applies to persons who have substantial, as distinct from minor impairments, and that these must be impairments that limit major life activities or bodily functions.",
      "The decision as to the appropriate accommodation for a specific individual must be based on the facts of each case. In selecting the reasonable accommodation to be provided, the principal test is that of effectiveness, i.e., whether the accommodation will enable the person with a disability to do the job in question. Must employers be familiar with the many diverse types of disabilities to know whether or how to make a reasonable accommodation? No. An employer is required to accommodate only a \"known\" disability of a qualified applicant or employee. The requirement generally will be triggered by a request from an individual with a disability, who frequently can suggest an appropriate accommodation. Accommodations must be made on an individual basis because the nature and extent of a disabling condition and the requirements of the job will vary in each case. If the individual does not request an accommodation, the employer is not obligated to provide one. If a disabled person requests, but cannot suggest, an appropriate accommodation, the employer and the individual should work together through an interactive process to identify one. There are also many public and private resources that can provide assistance without cost. Contact the Employee Relations Office at uscer@mailbox.sc.edu or 803-777-3821 for more information. What are the limitations on the obligation to make a reasonable accommodation? The disabled individual requiring the accommodation must be otherwise qualified, and the disability must be known to the employer. In addition, an employer is not required to make an accommodation if it would impose an \"undue hardship\" on the operation of the employer's business. \"Undue hardship\" is defined as \"an action requiring significant difficulty or expense\" when considered in light of a number of factors. These factors include the nature and cost of the accommodation in relation to the size, resources, nature, and structure of the employer's operation. Can an employer refuse to hire an applicant or fire a current employee who is illegally using drugs? Yes. Individuals who currently engage in the illegal use of drugs are specifically excluded from the definition of a \"qualified individual with a disability\" protected by the ADA when an action is taken on the basis of their drug use. Is testing for illegal drugs permissible under the ADA? Yes. A test for illegal drugs is not considered a medical examination under the ADA; therefore, employers may conduct such testing of applicants or employees and make employment decisions based on the results. The ADA does not encourage, prohibit, or authorize drug tests. Challenge the conventional. Create the exceptional. No Limits.",

The coaches know these students the best. They communicate with their student-athletes daily and see them at least 6 days a week. The coaches care for our student-athletes and want what is best for them as people, students, and athletes. We will do everything we can to support the faculty and staff in their efforts to serve the students. Many student-athletes aspire to attend and compete at USC Sumter for two years. Some come to USC Sumter with dual enrollment credits. If a student expresses that they would like to remain at USC Sumter, although it may be better academically for them to transfer, please support their decision. It takes a lot of time, relationship building, and connection to recruit student-athletes. We want to provide them the information but also support them if they express a desire to stay. I understand there may be circumstances when a student-athlete will have so many credits that their financial aid is affected but if the student-athlete understands the full picture of financial aid and academics, please support their decision. Our student-athletes are active with Athletics from August 1st to the end of May, and therefore on campus. Study hall is required for all student-athletes and is regulated by their coaches. Season Information Men\u2019s and women\u2019s golf and men\u2019s and women\u2019s tennis will both compete in a short season over the fall that may require them to miss class. All other sports should not be missing classes in their off seasons. Men\u2019s and Women\u2019s Golf travel on Sunday, Monday, Tuesday. There are no reschedules or options to change dates due to the golf course schedules. Each sport has an off-season where they are permitted to practice/train, condition, weight lift, and compete in scrimmages/friendlies. Student-Athlete Academic Schedule Most practice times will be in the afternoon. Student-athletes are encouraged to be done with classes by 2:15pm. Science Labs Fall sport student-athletes should take science labs in the spring (off-season). Spring sport student-athletes should take science labs in the fall (off-season). We understand there may be circumstances when this is not possible.",
      "Transcripts Transcripts are required for all students applying to residency programs. Unofficial transcripts will be produced by the admissions office and provided to the DWS. The DWS will upload all transcripts prior to September 15th. If you would like an updated transcript to be uploaded to your application after September 15th, please contact Dr. Eric Williams at eric.williams@uscmed.sc.edu. Letters of Recommendation Most programs require a minimum of three letters of recommendation. ERAS allows you to store an unlimited number of letters and to designate different letters for each program. However, you can\u2019t send more than four letters to an individual program. You should plan to ask for letters of recommendation at the end of your third year of medical school, between April and July, and no later than August of your fourth year. Be sure to give letter writers at least three to four weeks to write the letter. Potential letter writers may be attending physicians from third- or fourth-year rotations, department chairs, program directors, research collaborators, deans, and faculty with whom you worked in extracurricular activities. It\u2019s best to avoid asking residents to write letters. Letter authors upload their letters to the ERAS system. Check individual program websites and ERAS program information for details on what types of letters of recommendation are expected and when they are due. Please note that the medical school staff (including the DWS and other members of Student Services) are not allowed to have access to any LoR. The DWS may assist authors or their designees with the steps required to upload a LoR but cannot upload the letter themselves. USMLE Transcript The USMLE transcript is required by many M.D. residency programs as part of an application to be considered for their positions. Applicants should research programs individually for requirements related to the USMLE transcript (i.e. minimum scores). Applicants must authorize the release of their USMLE transcript and assign it to the programs they designate. The NBME or ECFMG (for IMG Residency) charges a fee of $80 for transmitting USMLE transcripts to the programs designated by applicants. You can view the USMLE Requests Status Report to track the status of your USMLE requests by program. If you have a new score become available you must take action in MyERAS to resend USMLE scores to programs previously designated to receive them. Photographs University of South Carolina School of Medicine Columbia hires a photographer for all M.D. students to have a professional head shot taken at the end of the third year. It is recommended that this photo be uploaded to MyERAS. The photo is most often used by programs to help identify applicants when reporting for an interview. You should research programs individually to verify their requirements and use of the photo. Applicants must upload their own photo in MyERAS and then make assignments of the photo to the programs they designate. Please note that the photo file must meet the following requirements: File Type: JPG/JPEG or PNG Maximum File Size: 100 KB Maximum Dimensions: 2.5 in. x 3.5 in. Maximum Resolution: 150 DPI Transition to Residency Expand all Temporary License Information All who matched must complete the temporary license requirement of the institution/state of the residency. States have different license requirements, so it\u2019s important that you review and complete all necessary paperwork in a timely fashion. Some forms cannot be completed until after your graduation day. In most cases, Dr. Rhinehart will need to sign and certify your date of graduation and/or degree completion. Forms that request the signature/verification of the \u201cDean\u201d will be completed by him as well. If an official transcript is required by your residency program, the certified/official transcript will be available approximately three weeks after your graduation date. The cost of an official transcript is $12.00 and can be requested at the link below. Please do not request the transcript now but wait until after your graduation date. If you were to request it now, it may be sent without having your degree conferred. The link to request a transcript is: https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/transcripts_and_records/transcripts/index.php. Programs may request references or letters of recommendation (LoR)."

      "How will the SCHC help me with my future plans? Honors classes go in depth to help students become more knowledgeable in their discipline, or pursue new topics they had not considered before. Small class sizes foster relationships with faculty who may turn into life-long mentors. Opportunities such as internships, research and service learning provide opportunities to apply your curriculum in hands-on settings, allowing you to prepare you for your future career and distinguish yourself as you pursue jobs or further education. Between our 36+ professional staff members and our Honors alumni network of over 10,000 graduates, you\u2019ll have a great support system in the Honors College! Will I receive honors credit for my AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses? Most of our students earn college credit before graduating from high school. Credits earned via AP/IB/Cambridge tests or dual-enrollment are not counted toward honors requirements, but they do count towards the Carolina Core, as appropriate(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/undergraduate_admissions/requirements/for_freshmen/ap_ib_credits/) . These credits often serve as pre-requisites for upper-level courses and can allow room in your course of study for higher-level courses. You can discuss your options with your advisor. Why don't you accept AP/IB and dual-enrollment courses for Honors? The premise of an AP/IB or dual-enrollment course is that it is equivalent to a college course. They are not designed as Honors College courses. This is a common practice amongst honors colleges and programs across the country. How do students apply their AP/IB or dual-enrollment courses as Honors students? There are many ways! These credits often apply towards Carolina Core requirements, allowing students more flexibility in their schedule to take exploratory seminar classes. It is not uncommon for Honors students to double major or add a minor with room in their schedule due to credits earned in high school. Students may also choose to shorten their time in undergraduate studies by graduating early or taking graduate level coursework as a senior. Given the rigor of the Honors requirements, however, we do not generally see students graduate with honors in two or fewer years. All of these options can be tailored to your needs and discussed in-depth with your advisor. How are Honors students involved at USC? It is up to each student how much they want to get involved, but Honors students tend to do a lot outside the classroom, holding nearly 30% of leadership positions on campus, despite being about 8% of the undergraduate population. They are involved in band, Greek life, athletics, student government, community service and much more! Honors is full of motivated students and being in Honors will not prevent you from taking advantage of all the opportunities at the University of South Carolina. Have more questions?

Students who earn Graduation with Leadership Distinction demonstrate extensive, purposeful engagement beyond the classroom, understanding of course concepts in \u201creal world\u201d settings, and application of learning to make decisions and solve problems.

      "Graduating the next distinguished leaders - USC News & Events | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Graduating the next distinguished leaders Posted on: December 10, 2015; Updated on: December 10, 2015 By Megan Sexton, msexton@mailbox.sc.edu , 803-777-1421 More than 2,600 degree candidates will graduate at Monday's 3:30 p.m. commencement at the Colonial Life Arena. Charleston Mayor Joe Riley, who is retiring this year after leading the city since 1975, will deliver the commencement address. As students walk across the stage Monday for the final commencement of 2015, the university completes a record year for the number of students earning Graduation with Leadership Distinction on their diplomas. Nearly 40 students at the December commencement will receive the GLD honor, bringing the total of 2015 graduates to 248. These students engage in beyond-the-classroom learning, document their activities and reflect on their overall college experiences in an e-portfolio. The honor is posted on transcripts and diplomas, which can help as they apply to graduate schools or enter the job market. In 2014, there were 105 graduates with leadership distinction. Irma Van Scoy , director of USC Connect, says most students initially pursue the GLD because they want the recognition on their transcript and diploma. \"That's what gets them interested, but by the time they finish the process, they can really articulate the significance of their undergraduate education \u2014 what they have learned in class and out of class,\" Van Scoy says. \"They end up saying, 'This is one of the most valuable things I've done at USC and now I know where I'm going.' \" More than 850 Carolina students are now pursuing the GLD recognition, with more than 300 expected to graduate in May 2016. Students in every college and school at the university, along with students from the four Palmetto College campuses, are represented in the program. Van Scoy says the GLD program has helped people understand integrated learning and offers students a chance to take related coursework, demonstrate what they've learned through a presentation, reflect on their undergraduate experience and consider how they will apply learning to lead in the future. Students can choose one of four GLD paths: community service, global learning, professional and civic engagement or research. One of the students graduating Monday is Max D. Emory of Lancaster, S.C., who will earn his degree in mechanical engineering with leadership distinction in professional and civic engagement. He has accepted a position at Savannah River Nuclear Solutions' Engineering Leadership Development Program. \"Outside of GLD allowing me to learn a lot about myself, it has really boosted my confidence and solidified my thoughts about who I am and what I am passionate about. GLD was not easy to obtain by any means and challenged me in different ways. With the help of my adviser, Lisa Camp, I really enjoyed my experience,\" Emory says. \"We, as college students, are involved in so many different things throughout our journey we don't take the time to look back at what we've accomplished and learned. GLD gave me the opportunity to do just that. I learned a lot about my own experiences, that I thought were insignificant at the time but that really changed the way I think about things today. \"GLD has made me more excited for my future. Not that I wasn't excited before, but seeing other people excited about my passion and where I am headed has really energized me and reassured me that I am on the right track.\" Grace Gardner of Cincinnati will graduate with a major of international studies and women's and gender studies and a minor in leadership studies. She plans to move home to Ohio, where she will explore a career in medicine, possibly in an accelerated nursing degree program. She also has applied to the Peace Corps. She chose to pursue GLD after she applied to be an Emerging Leaders Program mentor in the fall of her junior year. The interviewer pointed out that Gardner already had many of the pieces for the GLD. \"I'm so glad I chose this track at USC because it gave meaning to all the positions I held in my time here."

Here are the stages we'll work through to transform your course from a concept into an accessible option for online learning. Expand all Course Planning Developing online courses begins with careful planning and quality course design. When you have an idea for a course, we can help you work through the conceptual and delivery details. We can help you effectively plan and prepare for the multi-step approval process to transform your course from a concept into an accessible option for online learning. As you plan your course structure and select the most appropriate delivery format, you may also work closely with an instructional designer to establish pedagogy goals, learning outcomes, build your syllabus and more. Typically, it takes anywhere from 3-6 months to plan a course and develop content for online delivery. To teach a course online - either in a fully online, blended, or hybrid format \u2013 the course needs to be approved for distance education delivery per Policy ACAF 2.03 . A list of courses approved for distance education delivery is available here . Approval Process Members of the Faculty Senate guide and approve any online courses through an established review. Throughout the step-by-step process, you may need to modify your academic proposal based on insight from committee reviewers. Our team works closely with the Office of Academic Programs and can help guide you through the Distance Education Delivery Approval process. Our team works closely with the Office of Academic Programs and can help guide you through the Distance Education Delivery Approval process. Visit the Office of Academic Program\u2019s website for additional information. If you are interested in creating a new online course or converting an existing face-to-face course to online format, please refer to the Academic Proposals Program System (APPS) , a secure, web-based submission and approval system that facilitates the review process for adding or changing any University of South Carolina academic course. The step-by-step process may take several months to complete and the course proposal may need to be revised based on feedback from committee reviewers. You should also refer to the Committee on Curricula & Courses(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/faculty_senate/committees/curricula-course/index.php) requirements for distance education delivery before submitting a new course or course change request. It is also recommended that you work with an instructional designer to ensure the course meets quality assurance standards and best practices and that all course materials are accessible for students with disabilities.

You may need to select an alternate section of the course. Click the course title to view information about the specific class/section (for example: \u201cRestricted to X college\u201d). Restricted sections often will have a letter before the section number number (A, C, R, T, P, H, and S). J sections are online and Z sections are located at Fort Jackson and require special enrollment permissions. View the registration holds and course restrictions document for more information. I'm getting an error when registering. If possible, screenshot the error message (for example: \"field of study\" or \"classification\") and send it to your advisor for assistance. Also, view the video, \"How to Identify Class Registration Restrictions\"(https://youtu.be/FHWbXhCFNWM) to see why you may not be able to enroll in a class. Some sections are restricted to certain majors or student populations. For details about a course/section, click on the course title to view more information about the specific class/section. Note: Some colleges may restrict registration to majors only for a specific period of time (i.e. the first three weeks of registration) after which other students may register for remaining seats. There may also be a delay in registration for courses needed for a minor. Can I get into a class that is full? Try to find an open section and know that course enrollment will fluctuate until the add/drop deadline. Some departments provide online forms you can complete to be notified when additional seats are added. Completing an online form does not guarantee a seat in the class or a seat into a specific section. Seat availability requests, notifications and waitlists(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/advising/documents/override_request_and_seat_notification.pdf) for some departments can be found online. You may also use the Coursicle app to track the enrollment in the course sections that you are hoping to enroll in, and the app will notify you when a seat as opened up.

      "8. Why can\u2019t I register for a particular course? First, check the section number, and click on the CRN or course name to read the fine print (aka course restrictions). Sections beginning with a letter are restricted to certain student populations and you may not register unless you are part of that population. Common letters are \u2018H\u2019 means Honors College; \u2018T\u2019 means Opportunity Scholars, \u2018S\u2019 may be used for a variety of groups. None of these subsets offer overrides. If the course you are trying for is restricted to another subset (i.e. a particular major or college), you must contact the department offering the course to request an override. If you are having difficulty registering for CHEM 111 or 112, and you have the necessary prerequisites (including MATH), try this: when you register for CHEM 111, make sure you check the box for the lecture and the box for a CHEM 111L lab section, and then click \u2018Add\u2019 so you\u2019re registering for both at the same time. The system considers the lab a prereq for the lecture and so will block your registration if you try to register for the lecture only. If a BIOL, MATH, CHEM, or PHYS course is full\u2014Each department has a seat override request form. Please add your name as soon as possible. Links to each form are below: BIOL(https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSc7VJWG4rA1Tx7ZM7GR3thJLLzA0aRAAWwhSeD9X0R3v9Xt3w/viewform) MATH(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/mathematics/study/overrides/) CHEM(https://forms.office.com/Pages/ResponsePage.aspx?Host=Teams&lang=%7Blocale%7D&groupId=%7BgroupId%7D&tid=%7Btid%7D&teamsTheme=%7Btheme%7D&upn=%7Bupn%7D&id=GUsqSzXRDkKLsrHNI4mYzET29-j0QyVBux8yaAo3iDhUM0xNSzkyQkk4R0lKTFVSRFA2WUJONVk3SiQlQCN0PWcu) PHYS(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/physics_and_astronomy/my_physics/200_level_laboratories/index.php) If your major requires BIOL 101/L and/or BIOL 102/L, but you\u2019re getting a field of study restriction, contact the Biology student services office ( Avette@mailbox.sc.edu ) and ask for an override. Tell them your VIP ID, the specific course/section you want, and the fact that the course is required for your major. 9. How do I register for independent study or thesis credits? Independent study, research, internship and thesis credits (ENVR 399, 499; GEOL 399, 498-99, 699; MSCI 399, 495-499) require an independent study contract ( https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/documents/undergraduate-independent-study-contract.pdf ). While the student and instructor are completing all of the fields in the contract, please contact the Undergraduate Coordinator (Sheri Foxworth, Foxworth@sc.edu ) and request a CRN and section number for the specific class. You must provide Sheri with: Course number, Instructor name and ID, and semester in which the course will be taken. She will provide the Section and CRN for you to enter on the form. When completed and signed by student and instructor, bring or send via email the completed document to Jones 108 for processing. The Undergraduate Director will sign for the Department chair/Area of Course Head, then contact the student to send the contract to the Dean\u2019s Office (110 Flinn Hall.) 10. How do I take courses somewhere else and transfer the credits back to USC? Students wishing to take summer courses at another USC campus or another college must complete a Special Enrollment Request Form (also referred as a Transient Student Enrollment Form) ( https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/documents/special-enrollment-request.pdf ).",

      "Frequently Asked Questions - Online Courses | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Online Courses SC.edu Study Online Courses Frequently Asked Questions Frequently Asked Questions We\u2019ve compiled a list of the questions we get asked the most often. Courses Expand all Is a course I'm interested in provided online? You can search for distributed learning courses using our website(https://sc.edu/study/academic_overview/online_education/courses/course_search/index.php) or through the Self Services Carolina (SSC) Program(https://ssb.onecarolina.sc.edu) . Some courses may have restrictions (i.e., enrollment capacity, field of study, campus, etc.) placed on them by the departments, colleges/schools and/or campuses. How do I enroll in an online course? Current students: Log in to https://my.sc.edu(https://my.sc.edu/) and sign in to the Self Services Carolina (SSC) Program(https://ssb.onecarolina.sc.edu) to register. Non-USC students: Apply for admission depending on your circumstances (e.g., degree-seeking or non-degree seeking) and the level of the course or program of study in which you are interested. For additional information about admission requirements, visit the Undergraduate Admissions Office or the Graduate School(http://www.gradschool.sc.edu/) websites. How do I register for an online course if it has a restriction? You may contact the department offering the course to request an override to enroll in the course. Override requests are handled by the departments within the college/school offering the course and require their approval. What is the cost of an online course? Tuition and fees vary depending on total course hours, college/school or department offering the course, your residency status, and college campus. Tuition and fee information(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/bursar/tuition_and_required_fees/index.php) is available on the Bursar\u2019s Office website. Can I get a copy of the syllabus before I enroll? Instructors who use Blackboard may post the course syllabus prior to the start of the semester. If you require a syllabus prior to registering for the course, you may want to contact the instructor. How do I access the online course after registering? If your course is taught using Blackboard, you will be able to access the course online through that Learning Management System. Instructors using other course delivery formats will send you instructions to access the course. Make sure you check your USC email account. Where do I find textbook information for my online course? Required textbook information is provided in the syllabus which may be posted in the course information in Blackboard prior to the start of the course. Are USC Columbia's online courses self-paced or schedule-based? Course formats vary. Some instructors choose to have a structured schedule with deadlines to be met along with required online course sessions or in-person events (such as an orientation, seminars, etc.). Other instructors choose not to have specific deadlines and allow students to access course materials and complete assignments at their discretion. It is important for you to read the syllabus carefully for this information and check your USC email account regularly. Courses must begin and end on the course dates as assigned according to the term in which the course is offered. These dates will be posted in the Self Services Carolina Program. Immunization Requirements Expand all Do online students have to provide immunization records? Online students must provide immunization records or complete the Distant Learner Waiver. Visit sc.edu/myhealthspace(https://myhealthspace.ushs.sc.edu/) to complete any immunization requirements or complete the Distant Learner Waiver.

Circumstances beyond the control of the University may require adjustment of these published charges without notice. The Schedule of Academic Charges is published annually and is available in June. All fees are payable in advance of or at registration. Payment applies only to the semester of registration and will not be credited to another semester except in the case of students granted military leave. Registration is complete when all charges are paid. The application for admission fee is payable when the application is filed; the matriculation fee is payable at the time the applicant accepts in writing the university's offer of admission. Billing Information Statements of student accounts are made available approximately 30 days prior to the term start date. Students may view and print their bills online at Life at MUSC Obligation for Payment Failure to make timely payments to remove any indebtedness to the University when due is considered sufficient cause to withhold diploma or transcripts, to suspend all University services, including enrollment, and to assign the student's account to a collection agency. The University reserves the right to assess interest, finance charges, and/or late fees on any indebtedness and all attorney's fees, collection agent cost, and other related cost and charges for the collection of any amount not paid when due. It is the policy of MUSC that a student's tuition account will be assessed an insufficient funds (NSF) fee for returned checks. The student will be notified by the University Bursar's Office explaining this situation. Should this situation cause tuition and fees to be unpaid after the first official day of class, a late fee will apply. Additionally, the Office of Student Accounts will place a tuition hold on the student's account until all tuition and fees are paid. Penalty will not be levied against financial aid recipients if the student can show that he/she was not responsible for the delay in the award. Methods of Payment ONLINE - Electronic Check: TouchNet - No Fee! - Pay online directly from your checking or savings account through TouchNet. Posts immediately - always confirm your payment posted to your statement through your Student Life Portal. Credit and Debit Cards (Online Only): American Express, Discover, MasterCard, Visa The convenience fee for credit/debit card transaction is 2.5% of the total payment amount. This fee will be added to your payment amount. MUSC does NOT accept in-person credit/debit card payments for tuition and fees** All credit card payments must be made online on Self-Service Menu at http://life.musc.edu(http://life.musc.edu) .

From there, you can pay the school (or reimburse yourself) for qualified expenses paid out of pocket. You can also send payments directly to MUSC, if you prefer. SCTPP - account owner will need to submit a copy of their South Carolina Tuition Prepayment Program (SCTPP) card to studacct@musc.edu in order to verify & and prepare the invoice for submission.

      "On Campus Dual Enrollment Agreement High School Transcript : Every student must provide an official high school transcript. Before You Enroll If you decide to enroll in a course for dual credit, please be aware of the following facts: You are establishing a permanent college transcript so your success is very important. Dual enrollment courses do count toward the GPA and hours earned as part of a student\u2019s first year in college which can affect eligibility for financial aid programs in the second year of college. Students are responsible for maintaining the academic standards of the University of South Carolina as stated in the USCL Student Handbook. Dropping a Course You must follow certain procedures and be aware of your high school\u2019s deadline for schedule adjustment when dropping a course. If you would like to drop a course, check with your teacher to find out the last date to drop without a WF (withdrew failing) appearing on your USCL transcript. Simply changing your class schedule at the high school does not drop you from the official class roll. If you are taking classes at your high school, you must notify your school counselor that you wish to drop the course and the counselor will notify the Dual Enrollment Coordinator in writing. If you are taking classes on the university\u2019s campus, you will need to go to the Office of Admissions to complete a withdrawal form. Failure to follow these procedures may result in an \u201cF\u201d being placed on your permanent University record. Transfer of College Credits At the end of the course, credit earned by satisfactory completion of dual enrollment courses (usually an earned grade of \u201cC\u201d or higher) will transfer to public South Carolina institutions, provided that the course is included on the List of Transferable Courses in the Statewide Transfer and Articulation Policy.(https://www.sctrac.org/) If the course is not included on the above list, you are responsible for contacting the higher education institution to see if the course credit will be accepted. If you plan on attending a private institution in South Carolina or any public or private institutions outside of South Carolina, you are responsible for contacting the institution and obtaining written assurance that the dual enrollment course credit will apply toward your degree requirements. Transcripts At the end of the course, you can check your grade and request a transcript online. To request credit transfer to schools other than USC, a student must have an official transcript sent to that school\u2019s records office. If you are applying to more than one school, you can request an official transcript be sent to each one. Absences High School Dual Enrollment courses follow the standard attendance policy as stated in the USCL Academic Bulletin. Absence from more than 10 percent of the scheduled class sessions whether excused or unexcused is excessive and may result in a grade penalty. Testing Tests must be taken on the assigned dates. Makeup tests are only permitted in extreme cases. Confidentiality of Student Records In accordance with the Family Education Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) of l974, USCL students have the right to review, inspect, and challenge the accuracy of information kept in a cumulative file by the institution unless the student waives this right. It also ensures that records cannot be released in other than emergency situations without the written consent of the student. For more information on FERPA policy, see the USCL Student Handbook at the above referenced web page. Off-Campus Access to Library Resources Access to Medford Library\u2019s Electronic Resources is available from off-campus to currently enrolled students using EZProxy access. Equal Opportunity The University of South Carolina does not discriminate in educational or employment opportunities or decisions for qualified persons on the basis of race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, sexual orientation, or veteran status. The University of South Carolina has designated as the ADA Title II, Section 504 and Title IX coordinator the Executive Assistant to the President for Equal Opportunity Programs. The Office of the Executive Assistant to the President for Equal Opportunity Programs is located at 1600 Hampton Street, Columbia, SC; telephone 803-777-3854.

      "Providing help when they need it can greatly reduce student anxiety levels. Ask a colleague to read the exam to make sure all test items and instructions are understandable and do not cause confusion for your students. If you distribute a paper-based exam, be sure to double-check the documents for typographical errors before printing. For online exams, double-check your settings to ensure that the exam will go live at the expected time. For face-to-face courses, remind students about the date, day, time and room number for the final exam. Because they are often scheduled differently than your class sessions, students sometimes become confused about the day and time for finals. For online courses, remind students of the time and length of the exam, and reinforce the importance of securing a well-functioning computer and reliable Internet service before accessing the exam.

      "Online courses should specify any penalties for not participating in activities in the allotted time without a valid excuse. Instructors have full discretion to set their own policy regarding the late acceptance of course work missed due to an unexcused absence; this policy should be specified in the course syllabus. Examination Policies Final Examinations Final examinations for spring and fall semesters are held during a seven-day period at the close of each semester. Summer examinations are held during a two-day period at the close of each session. Semester examination schedules are published on the registrar\u2019s Web site under the \u201cCalendar\u201d link. The results of these examinations, combined with the grades for class performance, determine the reports given at the end of the semester. No final examination may be held outside of the stated time without the special permission of the dean of the college concerned. Reading Day is specified in the University calendar and no exams, quizzes or required class attendance may be scheduled for that day. In any course or laboratory which meets two or three times per week, no quiz, test, or examination may be given during the last two class meetings prior to the regularly scheduled examination period. In any course or laboratory which meets once a week, no quiz, test, or examination may be given during the last class meeting prior to the regular examination period. In any course or laboratory which meets more than three times per week, no quiz, test, or examination may be given during the last three class meetings prior to the regular examination period. Self-paced courses are exempt from this regulation. If an instructor teaches more than one section of the same course, students may transfer from one examination section to another with the instructor\u2019s permission. Students who are absent from any final examination will be given the grade of F on the course if they have not offered an excuse acceptable to the instructor. If excused, they will be assigned a grade of I (see \u201cI\u201d entry under \u201cGrading System\u201d), and may complete the course under the conditions specified by the instructor in the \u201cAssignment of Incomplete Grade\u201d form. Re-examinations for the purpose of removing an F or raising a grade are not permitted. Graduating Seniors No early examinations are given for graduating seniors. Students who have submitted a degree application may attend the graduation ceremony. Diplomas are mailed after final examinations and after a student\u2019s dean has verified that all degree requirements have been met. Deferred Examinations A student with excused absences from final examinations in one semester has the privilege of deferred or special examinations and may take the deferred examination at the next regular examination period, with credit for semester standing, provided the examination is taken at the convenience of the professor. The examination must be taken within one calendar year from the time that the absence was incurred. Deferred examinations will be granted only in case of absence certified as unavoidable because of sickness or other cause, rendering attendance at final examinations impossible. Grading Policies Grading System Enrollment in a course obligates the student not only for prompt completion of all work assigned but also for punctual and regular attendance and for participation in whatever class discussion may occur. It is the student\u2019s responsibility to keep informed concerning all assignments made. Absences, whether excused or unexcused, do not absolve the student from this responsibility. Students\u2019 grades in their courses are determined by class standing and examination grade, combined in such proportion as the professor may decide. Class standing is determined by the quality of a student\u2019s work and the regularity of attendance in lectures and laboratory sessions or other exercises of the course. Grading systems in graduate and professional schools are described in the appropriate bulletins. A, B, C, D represent passing grades in order from highest to lowest. B+, C+, D+ may also be recorded. F represents failing performance. S and U indicate, respectively, satisfactory (passing) and unsatisfactory (failing) performance in courses carried under the Pass-Fail option. The S/U designation is used also for some research courses, workshops, and seminars in which the regular academic grades are not used. The use of the Pass-Fail grading option in such courses is indicated in their bulletin descriptions. No course carried under the Pass-Fail option will affect a student\u2019s grade point average or the evaluation of suspension conditions. FN (Failure-Non Attendance) and UN (Unsatisfactory-Non Attendance) grades are assigned to students who never attended or have stopped attending class but have not officially dropped or withdrawn. Faculty are required to provide a last date of attendance when assigning this grade. The grade and the last date of attendance are used in determining the recalculation of awarded funds for financial aid recipients. Reporting the last date of attendance is critical to avoid potential financial liability for the institution."

      "Clocks will be maintained in each of the classrooms. Students will be assigned a password to access electronic exams. It is highly recommended that students use a hardwire connection to the internet for accessing electronic exams. If a student forgets his/her cable or simply wants to use Wi-Fi, he/she assumes responsibility for a lost wireless connection. For in-class examinations, a student who has technical problems in accessing or completing an electronic exam, a penalty may be given for providing him/her with a print copy. The penalty, if any, is specified in the course syllabus. In the case of virtually proctored electronic examinations, any student experiencing technical difficulties at the time of an exam is expected to contact the USC College of Pharmacy information technology (IT) support staff and the course coordinator upon realizing that a problem exists. Students are expected to arrive on time for scheduled exams. Students are expected to begin virtually proctored examinations at the respective course\u2019s start time or as instructed by the course coordinator. Arriving late to an exam or starting a virtually proctored examination late when not due to technical difficulties reported to the course coordinator and IT staff are unprofessional and considered in violation of the professionalism policy. Grade sanctions for students arriving late to an exam are specified in each course syllabus. Students who are repeatedly late for exams will be referred to the Professionalism Committee. If a student is late to an exam for an extenuating circumstance, proof must be provided to the Associate Dean for Student Affairs or Senior Associate Dean in order to prevent sanctions. Questions relating to exam content are strictly prohibited during the examination. Questions regarding suspected typing errors on the test (e.g. omissions, misnumbering, defective exam pages, etc.) are permitted, though may be addressed post-test in order to remain fair to students completing exams in alternate locations or on alternate dates. Food or beverages are not allowed during examinations. All food containers and beverages should be placed at the front or sides of the classroom along with book bags or otherwise stored in a separate location from the test-taker. Restroom breaks are discouraged during in-class examinations and prohibited during virtually proctored examinations. If restroom breaks are needed during an in-class examination, only one student at a time will be allowed to leave the exam room and a faculty member may accompany the student. Students must leave all belongings in the classroom in this situation to avoid perceived or real academic integrity incidences. Cheating in any form is not allowed and will be considered an honor code violation and immediately referred to the USC Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity. Course coordinators may enact grade sanctions for the course dependent on the USC Office of Student Conduct and Academic Integrity resolutions. Students should take all personal items and exit the exam room upon completion of in-class exams. Students are not permitted to reenter the exam room until all students have completed the exam.

Be aware that not all students have access to a webcam and the University does not have the ability to provide this technology. Are there final exam considerations for students with disabilities? You should have received accommodation letters for students with disabilities who are enrolled in your course(s). Be sure to review the accommodation letters if you are providing an online exam. The most commonly used accommodation is extra time on exams. Be flexible. The length of time a student sits and views a computer screen can be problematic and students may need to use the restroom or stretch during a long exam. Clearly communicate expectations in a timely manner to all students (e.g., who to contact for technical issues, how the exam will be proctored, technology requirements, testing platform). If you have questions about considerations for students with disabilities, please contact the Student Disability Resource Center(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/student_disability_resource_center/index.php) at SADRC@mailbox.sc.edu . A student in my class is impacted by an extenuating circumstance that prevents them from completing the final exam during the established time period. What should I do? Similar to cases in which you might assign a grade of \u201cIncomplete,\u201d you should use your discretion to determine the extent of the problem and if possible require documentation of the issue (i.e. a written statement from a physician, counselor, safety officer, or other qualified professional). Do not retain such information in your course records; validate and discard. Understand that technical problems might also be an extenuating circumstance. Using your best judgement and interest in the student\u2019s academic success, you may arrange an alternative time period and date(s) that is suitable to the student and you. What if a student has technology needs? Faculty should direct students to the Thomas Cooper Library with their Carolina Card to check out the technology that is needed.

To change your major within the College of Arts and Sciences visit the Office of Undergraduate Studies or make an exploratory advising appointment with the University Advising Center(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/advising/changing_majors/index.php) . Some majors have special admission requirements and procedures; ask your major change advisor about these requirements. If you want to change to a major in another college or school of the university, you must make an exploratory advising appointment with the University Advising Center(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/advising/changing_majors/index.php) to learn about eligibility, requirements, and major change procedures.

How do I find the name of my advisor? If you are a freshman, you are assigned to a first-year advisor who advised you at summer orientation. The first-year advisor will contact you via email when it is time for advisement. If you are a sophomore, junior or senior, your advisor is assigned by your major department. It is your responsibility to contact your major department to find this information and arrange for your advisement. How do I get an override into a class that is already full? Closed courses and those requiring special permission require an override, which can only be granted by the department. Contact the department(https://www.sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/internal/undergrad_students/advisors_ugrad_directors.php) offering the course to request an override. After receiving an override or special permission, you must complete a registration transaction through the Self Service Carolina(https://my.sc.edu/) . Departments do not complete registration transactions for students. What is an overload? The normal course load is 15-18 credit hours per semester. Any course load above 18 hours is classified as an overload and requires special permission from the Office of Undergraduate Studies. Overloads are only granted to students who have attained an average of 3.0 or better on a minimum of 12 hours taken on a non-pass/fail basis in the previous full semester. You will need to speak with a team member at the Office of Undergraduate Studies for permission to take more than 18 credit hours. What is the pass/fail option? The Pass-Fail program is designed to encourage students to investigate fields outside of their major curriculum in which they have a specific personal interest, without affecting their grade point average. The only grades assigned on courses taken under the Pass-Fail option are S and U; a grade of S indicates satisfactory performance, while a grade of U indicates unsatisfactory progress. A student will only be given credit for courses in which the grade of S is earned. You can elect the pass/fail option on an elective course by completing a Pass/Fail Form[pdf](https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/documents/pass_fail_option_form.pdf) available from the Office of the Registrar(http://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/index.php) before the date specified in Master Schedule(http://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/registrar/academic_calendars/index.php) ."

Instead, we use a notification list to inform students when we open more seats for a course\u2014whether it is for an existing section or for a new section. After those on the list are alerted of seat openings for a course, the seats become available on a first come, first served basis - whoever registers first for an open seat will get it. We cannot reserve any seats for individual students. It is therefore important to regularly check your USC email. You should also continue to monitor Self-Service Carolina in the event a seat becomes available because a student drops the course. Please be aware that even if you add your name to the notification list, there is no guarantee that more seats will be opened.

Faculty can not give overrides of any kind for any reason for any class. FAQs Expand all What if I want to get into a particular section of a course? There is no need to indicate the section you need. We will notify you whenever we create seats for a course, including if we create additional seats in the section you happen to need, whatever it is. When we notify you, you should also be sure to check whether there are new sections created of the course you want that will fit into your schedule. I was signed up for the section that I wanted, and now the instructor changed to a different section that is full? How do I get into the section the instructor is teaching now? We cannot accommodate this. The instructor that is assigned to a section can change or switch at any time prior to the semester or summer session starting. We try to indicate early on for some of the sections who the instructors will be, but there are a number of reasons that the instructors may need to change. We cannot assign a student to a particular instructor. How do I get an override for MATH 300 or for a 500 level MATH course? This is done the same way. Fill out the notification list indicated in the first question above. The only difference is that we may give you an override into the requested course and contact you directly. Note that an override does not register you for the course; you will still need to do that yourself. I saw some open seats, and I wasn't notified about them. What happened? We only notify students for courses when we create seats in them. There are other reasons seats can become available. In particular, if a student drops a section, which is out of our control, a seat will become available, but we will not know and will not notify you. I saw that an override was given for a course that I wanted, but you indicate that doesn't happen. What's up with that? Looks can be deceiving. Sometimes caps (the number of seats available in a course) are lowered (for example, to help us balance enrollments in different sections). This will cause an appearance that overrides were given. Also, enrollments in courses taught through the South Carolina Honors College or the Opportunities Scholars' Program are not handled through the Mathematics Department, even though they may be mathematics courses. We do not control how registration is handled for these, and overrides for students in these programs may occur for these courses. Challenge the conventional. Create the exceptional. No Limits.",

    "query": "What is the pass/fail option?",
    "response": "The Pass-Fail option is a program at the University of South Carolina designed to encourage students to investigate fields outside of their major curriculum in which they have a specific personal interest without affecting their grade point average. Only two grades are assigned on courses taken under the Pass-Fail option: S (satisfactory performance) and U (unsatisfactory progress). A student will be given credit for courses in which the grade of S is earned, but these courses will not affect the computation of the grade point average. Specific provisions of the Pass-Fail program include it being in effect for an indefinite period of time, subject to periodic review, not being available to undergraduate students whose semester or cumulative GPA is less than 2.00, allowing students to exercise the Pass-Fail option only on free elective courses, limiting students to taking no more than eight courses on a Pass-Fail basis during their undergraduate career, requiring permission from the dean of the college and the student\u2019s academic advisor, having a deadline to elect or revoke the option by the last date for withdrawing from the course without a penalty, allowing normal prerequisites to be waived for students taking a course on a Pass-Fail basis, excluding such courses from the calculation of the grade point average, entering a grade of S for a regularly assigned passing grade and U for a failing grade, and not counting any course carried on a Pass-Fail basis toward the hours required for either the President\u2019s or the Dean\u2019s Honor List. A verified learning-disabled student may take on a Pass-Fail basis an elective or required course which is not in the major if the academic advisory plan so recommends the Pass-Fail option for that course. Learning-disabled students may meet specific degree requirements with a satisfactory grade with the approval of the academic dean. For Spring 2020, undergraduate students enrolled in the semester had the following grading accommodations due to the COVID-19 pandemic: all courses will be graded as originally planned according to grading criteria in course syllabi, after grades are submitted at the end of the semester, undergraduates can choose, on a course-by-course basis, to request a pass/fail grade for the Spring 2020 semester with the exception of Graduate or professional school courses, which can be taken as pass/fail only when deemed appropriate by the program",

Spring 2020 Undergraduate Pass-Fail Grading Approved by the USC Faculty Senate on April 1, 2020 To address complications presented by the COVID19 pandemic, the Faculty Senate Steering Committee approved the following grading accommodations for undergraduate students enrolled in Spring 2020. All courses will be graded as originally planned according to grading criteria in course syllabi. After grades are submitted at the end of the semester, undergraduates can choose, on a course-by-course basis, to request a pass/fail grade for the Spring 2020 semester with the exception of Graduate or professional school courses, which can be taken as pass/fail only when deemed appropriate by the program or school Dean. The following pass/fail scale will be used: Earned grades of A, B+, B, C+, and C will be replaced with S+, earned grades of D+ and D will be replaced with S, and an earned grade of F will be replaced with U. If students select the S+/S/U grading scale for a course, points will not be factored into the GPA. Courses with S+ and S will count towards earned semester hours. Courses graded with the S+/S/U scale, under this exception for Spring 2020, will count towards applicable curricular, major, continuation, and graduation requirements. For example, if a course requires a C or better in a prerequisite, students selecting this alternative grading scale would need an S+ in the prerequisite course. Faculty members will not be aware of students who select the pass/fail grading option when entering final grades. Grades will be entered in the format for which the course was approved. Students who previously decided to take a course on a pass/fail basis will continue on a pass/fail basis using the University\u2019s established S/U system (e.g., S is earned if the grade is D or above and U is earned for grades below D). For the Spring 2020 semester, undergraduate students who choose to replace a course letter grade with the S+/S/U option must do so no later than July 1, 2020. This process will occur through the Office of the University Registrar. A form will be available on the University Registrar website for the student to request that a letter grade be replaced with the S+/S/U scale. USC will include a transcript note on all academic records, regardless of grading basis, indicating the extraordinary circumstances of the global public health emergency during Spring 2020. Because some graduate and professional programs require letter grades to be reflected on transcripts, when necessary, students will be able to request an official letter attesting to the letter grade earned in any classes that were converted to S+/S/U.

    "response": "Yes, you can take courses at another institution during the summer, provided that they are from a regionally accredited post-secondary institution or have been recommended by a NACES-member external evaluation service if taken at a foreign post-secondary institution. However, you must have these transfer courses evaluated by the University before enrolling in class at the University to know definitively the transferability and equivalency of each transfer course. Keep in mind that transfer courses with a grade lower than 2.0 on a 4-point scale, or equivalent, taken by a degree-seeking University of South Carolina student without prior approval, or taken while a student is on an academic suspension from a University of South Carolina campus, will not be accepted. Also, courses that are occupational or technical in nature or essentially remedial in nature will not be applicable towards any University of South Carolina academic program or degree.",

      "Note: These deadlines are subject to change at any time. Summer School Admission New students entering the University for the first time in a summer term who expect to continue studying toward a degree submit only one application. They must meet all requirements for admission as degree-seeking students before the beginning of the summer term. These students should not submit a separate application for the summer term. Summer Attendance Only Students who wish to attend the University for the summer only should refer to the \u201cAdmission as a Non-degree Seeking Candidate\u201d paragraph included in this section. Students enrolled in degree programs at another college or university who wish to take summer courses at USC as transients should seek written approval to take specific courses from a dean or department chair at their home institution. Transfer Admission A transfer applicant is an individual who has attended another regionally accredited college or university following graduation of high school or completion of a GED. Requirements Transfer applicants must have a Cumulative GPA of 2.0 or higher (4.0 scale). If fewer than 30 semester hours (45 quarter hours) of college-level work have been attempted, the applicant must also meet freshman admission requirements. Transfer Applicants Must Submit: Completed Application for Admission & Application Fee Official Transcripts Transcripts from all regionally accredited colleges and universities attended are required. Transcripts with in-progress work will not be accepted. If less than 30 semester hours (45 quarter hours) of college-level work were attempted, official high school transcripts or GED test scores are also required. Important Notes: A transfer grade point average is calculated using all credits attempted and all grades earned on college-level courses at regionally accredited institutions outside the USC System. Applicants with a GPA less than 2.0 (4.0 scale) will be reviewed by the designated admissions committee for a determination on admission to the institution. Applicants can update their start term within 365 days of submission. Transfer applicants are encouraged to apply 6-12 months prior to the term for which they seek admission. However, applications for admission will be accepted and reviewed year-round. Evaluation of Transfer Credits Transfer credits to USC must be from regionally accredited institutions for academic courses completed with grades of C- or better. Applicability of credits toward a particular degree is determined by the degree program in which the student enrolls. The number of credits acceptable to the University and the number which may apply toward a particular degree may differ. Original records are required for courses exempted at a previous college. Exemption credit or acceptance of transfer credit by another college has no bearing on the evaluation of transfer credit at the University of South Carolina. Students transferring to the University from another college or university must, before enrolling in class at the University, have their transcripts evaluated by the University. It is only in the light of such evaluation that students will know definitively the transferability and equivalency of each transfer course. Transferability refers to the conditions under which the University accepts credit for inclusion in the student\u2019s record. Transfer courses must have been taken at a regionally accredited post-secondary institution, or, if taken at a foreign post-secondary institution, have been recommended by a NACES - member external evaluation service. Coursework classified as remedial by the University will appear on the student\u2019s record, but will not be used to determine admission eligibility or a transfer GPA. Exceptions to this rule may be made by the Office of the Registrar when state scholarship eligibility rules require inclusion. Equivalency entails equating transfer credit, both in hours and content, to University of South Carolina coursework. The Registrar\u2019s Office works with USC colleges and schools to coordinate the process of transfer evaluation to equate transfer courses directly to courses in the USC course catalog; to subject codes which represent subjects not offered at USC ; or to subject codes that identify courses as remedial/technical/non-accredited coursework. Applicability of credit toward a degree refers to the prerogative of academic divisions to count specific credit toward the fulfillment of a student\u2019s degree requirements. The student\u2019s college, school or campus of enrollment is responsible for determining applicability. However, a transfer course is generally not applicable towards any University of South Carolina academic program or degree if: The transfer course was occupational or technical in nature (examples: welding, paralegal, radiography courses). The transfer course was essentially remedial in nature (example: Developmental English). A grade lower than 2.0 on a 4 point scale, or equivalent, was earned in the transfer course. The transfer course was taken by a degree-seeking University of South Carolina student without prior approval as described in the Earning Credit in Transient Status section of this bulletin. The transfer course was taken while a student was on an academic suspension from a University of South Carolina campus.",

Undergraduate students can choose from over 90 minors offered by USC, including eight below offered by the College of Engineering and Computing. Who should minor in engineering or computing? A minor is generally an optional degree component. A minor allows you to specialize in an area related to your major, broaden your education and enhance your degree, or study something completely different if you have multiple interests. A minor shows employers and graduate schools that you are hardworking and can handle an additional workload. On top of that, an engineering or computing minor is a bonus form of experience for entering certain job markets. Declaring a minor will require you to complete around six classes in the minor field of study. These courses may be in addition to your major program of study or may overlap with some of your normal program requirements. Before adding a minor, determine if the minor will extend your time to graduation, and if so, if the valued added is worth it; it often is. If you think a minor might be right for you, talk with your advisor.

A double degree is when a student takes a second major outside of the College of Arts and Sciences, such as Business. Students must earn a \"C\" or better for a class to count towards a minor or cognate. Note that pre-med, pre-law and pre-pharmacy cannot be minors. They can qualify as cognates but classes must be taken at the appropriate level. Notes on Cognates Please note to your students who choose the cognate option that most areas of study require them to take courses at the 300-level. For example, if a student wants to pursue an \"education cognate,\" all their courses should start at the 300-level and higher. There are exceptions to this rule such as philosophy cognates which can begin at the 200-level. The exceptions can be found in the student handbook. Minor Bulletin Encourage your students to choose a minor as soon as possible. Some minors require classes which are only offered in certain semesters or require prerequisites. The current minor bulletin can be found on the Undergraduate Bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/) . Senior Checks Students are advised to get a senior check done for them the semester before the semester they plan to graduate (so if they are graduating in May of any given year, they should do their senior check in the previous fall semester). This way, the undergraduate office in combination with the Dean's office can catch any errors in the student's file or warn them of classes they need to finish in order to graduate. Waiting until the semester of graduation poses a risk of not being able to sign up for a class that might be needed for graduation. Challenge the conventional. Create the exceptional. No Limits."

      "Second Major In some degree programs, a student may elect a second major. Normally, second majors are possible only in degree programs with similar general education requirements. The second major option is not available in all colleges. The student must meet admission and progression requirements for the second major. The student must have received approval from both deans for a second major. All requirements for the second major must be fulfilled. All general education and special departmental requirements normally associated with the second major must be fulfilled. In cases where the first major and the second major lead to different degrees, the student must designate one as the official degree of record. A second major eliminates the cognate requirement; however, special departmental requirements normally completed as part of the cognate are not waived. Fulfillment of the requirements for a second major are indicated on the student\u2019s official transcript upon graduation. No notation for a second major is placed on the official transcript for course work completed after graduation. Students who submit two degree applications for the same degree in the same college for a double major will receive one diploma. Indebtedness It is expected that students will discharge any indebtedness to the University as quickly as possible. No diploma, certificate, or enrollment verification will be issued to or for students who have not made satisfactory settlement with the Office of Financial Services for all of their indebtedness to the University. In certain circumstances, transcripts may also be withheld. Records, Transcript, and Enrollment Certification Policies Change of Name or Address It is the obligation of every student to notify the Office of the University Registrar of any change in name or address (including electronic address). Failure to do so can cause serious delay in the handling of student records and in notification of emergencies. Change of name may only be accomplished by presenting proper legal documentation. Transcripts A transcript of a student\u2019s record carries the following information: current status; a detailed statement of the scholastic record showing courses pursued with semester hours carried, semester hours earned, grades, grade points, grade point average, and system of grading; a permanent record of all failures, Incomplete grades, and penalties (such as suspension); cumulative USC grade totals; and references to other college or universities attended, dates attended, and the total transfer credits accepted by the University of South Carolina. Any student who needs a transcript or a certified copy of the end-of-semester grade report may complete a Transcript Request form or send a signed and dated letter containing all pertinent identifying information to the Office of the University Registrar. Official transcripts may also be requested online through Self Service Carolina(http://my.sc.edu) . With the exception of copies made for internal use, no copy of a student\u2019s permanent record (transcript) will be released to anyone without the student\u2019s written consent. In addition to the written consent, each transcript request should include full name or names used, student number, current mailing address, dates of attendance, location of attendance, and date of birth to assure proper identification of the record requested. In certain circumstances, transcripts may be withheld from a student who is indebted to the University. No partial transcript will be issued. The nonrefundable transcript processing fee is $12. Enrollment Certification Certification of enrollment is based upon the total number of credit hours for which a student is registered at the time of the certification request. Beginning and ending dates reported in enrollment certification conform to the official USC academic calendar dates for the term requested. Indebtedness It is expected that students will discharge any indebtedness to the University as quickly as possible. No diploma, certificate, or enrollment verification will be issued to or for students who have not made satisfactory settlement with the Office of Financial Services for all of their indebtedness to the University. In certain circumstances, transcripts may also be withheld. Notification of Student Rights under FERPA The Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) affords students certain rights with respect to their education records. These rights include: The right to inspect and review the student\u2019s education records within 45 days of the day the University receives a request for access. A student should submit to the registrar, dean, head of the academic department, or other appropriate official, a written request that identifies the record(s) the student wishes to inspect. The University official will make arrangements for access and notify the student of the time and place where the records may be inspected. If the records are not maintained by the University official to whom the request was submitted, that official shall advise the student of the correct official to whom the request should be addressed. The right to request the amendment of the student\u2019s education records that the student believes are inaccurate, misleading, or otherwise in violation of the student\u2019s privacy rights under FERPA."
