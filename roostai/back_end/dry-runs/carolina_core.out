What Makes up my Program of Study? In the College of Arts and Sciences, your program of study consists of the following requirements: Carolina Core, College Requirements, Electives, Program courses, Major courses, and either a Minor or Cognate. CAS programs require between 120 to 128 credit hours to graduate, depending upon your major. Learn more about the requirements below. Carolina Core The Carolina Core(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/) is a set of requirements that students across the University of South Carolina have to complete as part of their program of study. The Carolina Core is made up of 10 core components, each with a learning outcome and credit hour requirements. Click below on each requirement to learn more. You can find the entire list of Carolina Core applicable courses, as well as the requirements that they fulfill in the most recent academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/carolina-core-courses/#foundationalcoursestext) . College Requirements The College Requirements are different from the Carolina Core, in that they are only required for the specific college in which you are studying. While looking at the separate components of the Carolina Core above, you may have noticed that there is some overlap between Carolina Core and College Requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences. Click on each College Requirement below to learn more. For more information on the College Requirements, follow the link to the College of Arts and Sciences College Requirements on the academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/arts-sciences/#text) . Expand all Additional Humanities Every student within the College of Arts and Sciences is required to take at least one additional Humanities class. Students who are pursuing a BS are only required to take 3 hours of additional Humanities, while students who are pursuing a BA are required to take 9 hours of Additional Humanities (3 classes). Please see your advisor for a list of applicable courses. Founding Documents The Founding Documents requirement is required for students who entered USC in Fall 2021 or later. There are seven courses that can apply go towards this requirement, and they focus on America’s Founding Documents and works about African American’s struggles for freedom. Learn more about the Founding Documents requirement(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/internal/undergrad_students/founding_documents.php) . Expand all Tip: Have you taken HIST 111 to satisfy one of your GHS requirements? If so, HIST 111 will also count towards the Founding Documents requirement! The Founding Documents requirement is the only other place in your program of study besides the overlay, where one course can fulfill two requirements. Talk to your advisor about how to make the most out of the classes you take! Foreign Language As stated in the GFL section of the Carolina Core, as a CAS student, you will need to reach the 122 level of foreign language of your choice. How many hours of foreign language you will have to take is dependent on your Foreign Language Placement Test(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) score. You must register in advance to take this Placement test. Once you have your score, your advisor will help you register(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) for the appropriate foreign language class. Social Science As part of the CAS College Requirements, you will need one GSS Carolina Core and an additional Social Sciences class. While any of the GSS courses can apply towards this requirement, you can always ask your advisor for a list of applicable courses. U.S. History/Non-U.S. History The College of Arts and Sciences requires you to take both a US History class, as well as a Non-U.S. History class. One will count towards your Carolina Core GHS requirement and the second will apply towards your GHS College Requirement. (It doesn’t matter which goes where, just that both are completed.)

Begin by talking with the head of your academic unit and also to the Academic Program Liaison (APL) in your college or school. The APL has experience with academic program actions and can provide guidance on how to develop your idea and take it through the entire University Faculty Senate approval process. Procedures and guidelines for proposing a new course or course change are available from the Office of Academic Programs . Note that the Carolina Core Approval Committee will evaluate the proposed course ensuring that it meets all student achievements for the Core learning outcome, the course is at the 100 or 200 level, the course is open to all students (although there can be pre- or co-requisites and major-specific sections), and that the courses is appropriate for the proposing academic unit to teach. To submit a Carolina Core course or course change for approval, individuals who have authority to submit proposals (who can be identified by the Academic Program or the APL) start a new proposal in Academic Programs Proposal System ( APPS(https://cas.auth.sc.edu/cas/login?service=https%3a%2f%2fuscbulletins-next.sc.edu%2fcourseadmin%2f) ).

- Teaching and Advising - Office of the Provost | University of South Carolina Skip to Content Office of the Provost SC.edu About Offices and Divisions Office of the Provost Our Offices Undergraduate Studies Carolina Core For Faculty and Staff Teaching and Advising Teaching and Advising Teaching the Core There are two types of Carolina Core courses. Foundational courses are taken early in the undergraduate experience and apply across disciplines. Integrative courses are taken near the end of study and apply to discipline-specific majors. Colleges and programs will also have specific requirements in each major and in some cases will have a list of recommended Carolina Core courses. Faculty members teaching a foundational Carolina Core course will need to adopt the relevant Carolina Core learning outcomes particular to that class. All Carolina Core courses must cover the learning outcomes identified in the template syllabi of approved Core courses. Instructors may add additional course content, but the essential outcomes must be covered. An interactive list of Faculty Senate-approved courses meeting the Carolina Core requirements is available online. Prototypical syllabi are available for all Carolina Core courses. They include student achievements and illustrate options for tailoring the syllabi for individual classes. Select a course from the approved list to view the syllabus or see the Carolina Core Syllabus Requirements for Teaching [pdf] . Advising Students on the Core The Carolina Core curriculum covers students who entered USC-Columbia, Lancaster, Salkehatchie, Sumter, or Union, for the first time in Fall 2012 or later.

- What Makes up my Program of Study? - My Arts and Sciences | University of South Carolina Skip to Content My Arts and Sciences SC.edu Study Colleges and Schools My Arts and Sciences Undergraduate Students Advising For Students What Makes up my Program of Study? What Makes up my Program of Study? In the College of Arts and Sciences, your program of study consists of the following requirements: Carolina Core, College Requirements, Electives, Program courses, Major courses, and either a Minor or Cognate. CAS programs require between 120 to 128 credit hours to graduate, depending upon your major. Learn more about the requirements below. Carolina Core The Carolina Core(https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/academicpriorities/undergradstudies/carolinacore/) is a set of requirements that students across the University of South Carolina have to complete as part of their program of study. The Carolina Core is made up of 10 core components, each with a learning outcome and credit hour requirements. Click below on each requirement to learn more. You can find the entire list of Carolina Core applicable courses, as well as the requirements that they fulfill in the most recent academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/carolina-core-courses/#foundationalcoursestext) . College Requirements The College Requirements are different from the Carolina Core, in that they are only required for the specific college in which you are studying. While looking at the separate components of the Carolina Core above, you may have noticed that there is some overlap between Carolina Core and College Requirements for the College of Arts and Sciences. Click on each College Requirement below to learn more. For more information on the College Requirements, follow the link to the College of Arts and Sciences College Requirements on the academic bulletin(https://academicbulletins.sc.edu/undergraduate/arts-sciences/#text) . Expand all Additional Humanities Every student within the College of Arts and Sciences is required to take at least one additional Humanities class. Students who are pursuing a BS are only required to take 3 hours of additional Humanities, while students who are pursuing a BA are required to take 9 hours of Additional Humanities (3 classes). Please see your advisor for a list of applicable courses. Founding Documents The Founding Documents requirement is required for students who entered USC in Fall 2021 or later. There are seven courses that can apply go towards this requirement, and they focus on America’s Founding Documents and works about African American’s struggles for freedom. Learn more about the Founding Documents requirement(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/internal/undergrad_students/founding_documents.php) . Expand all Tip: Have you taken HIST 111 to satisfy one of your GHS requirements? If so, HIST 111 will also count towards the Founding Documents requirement! The Founding Documents requirement is the only other place in your program of study besides the overlay, where one course can fulfill two requirements. Talk to your advisor about how to make the most out of the classes you take! Foreign Language As stated in the GFL section of the Carolina Core, as a CAS student, you will need to reach the 122 level of foreign language of your choice. How many hours of foreign language you will have to take is dependent on your Foreign Language Placement Test(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) score. You must register in advance to take this Placement test. Once you have your score, your advisor will help you register(https://sc.edu/study/colleges_schools/artsandsciences/dllc/study/placement/register.php) for the appropriate foreign language class. Social Science As part of the CAS College Requirements, you will need one GSS Carolina Core and an additional Social Sciences class. While any of the GSS courses can apply towards this requirement, you can always ask your advisor for a list of applicable courses. U.S. History/Non-U.S. History The College of Arts and Sciences requires you to take both a US History class, as well as a Non-U.S. History class. One will count towards your Carolina Core GHS requirement and the second will apply towards your GHS College Requirement. (It doesn’t matter which goes where, just that both are completed.)

A: Carolina Core Overlay courses offer students the option of meeting two Carolina Core components in a single course. A maximum of two overlays is allowed. The total Carolina Core credit hours must add up to a minimum of 31 hours. This means that if you take an overlay course, it will satisfy two learning outcomes instead of just one, helping you save time and potentially combine similar subjects. Keep in mind that not all courses have overlay options, so check the course catalog or consult with your academic advisor to find out which courses offer overlays.
