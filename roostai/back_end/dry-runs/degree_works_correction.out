While most profile update requests are completed the day that they are received, all requests are subject to the work queue and employee leave schedules. Best Practices for Profile Updates When updating your biography, please do not refer to yourself as “Doctor” unless you are a medical doctor. This is University Communications’ policy(https://www.sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/communications/toolbox/voice/editorial-style/index.php) (not ours), and any "Drs." will be removed. In order to preserve any special formatting in your publication, presentation or awards lists, you will need to upload a file. .doc, .docx, and .rtf files are accepted. Please DO NOT USE MANUAL INDENTS to try and align your publication text. The website doesn’t understand manual indents, and in order for us to update your page, we have to undo the work you did creating them in the first place. Best Practices for Curriculum Vitae If you're adding a Curriculum Vitae or other document for download, please make sure to run an Accessibility Check(https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/office/improve-accessibility-with-the-accessibility-checker-a16f6de0-2f39-4a2b-8bd8-5ad801426c7f) on the document before saving as it a .pdf.
