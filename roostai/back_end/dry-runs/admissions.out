Answer: For admission to USC, students must meet certain criteria. Freshmen entering the USC Columbia Pre-Business division of the Moore School of Business must meet the campus requirements for admission, including having a minimum cumulative Institution GPA of 3.25, taking at least 15 USC credit hours, and completing calculus with a minimum grade of C. Students from other USC campuses who have no work from colleges outside of USC must also meet these requirements. Transfer students from other institutions must present a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.25 on all college work taken and have completed calculus with a minimum grade of C. Students who have taken fewer than 30 semester hours of college work must also meet Columbia campus freshman admission requirements. External transfers will only be considered for Fall Term admission.
