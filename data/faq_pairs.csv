question,answer
Can a program include more than one concentration?,"Yes, programs may have multiple concentrations within the major."
Can I choose specific (prescribed) courses as part of the Carolina Core for my program?,Yes. Certain programs may require courses that are approved as Carolina Core foundational courses. It makes sense that those programs would “prescribe” those courses as required for the particular Carolina Core component that they fulfill.
Do all changes to a cross-listed course affect any cross-listed course(s) as well?,Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Getting approval for distributed learning for one cross-listed course does not automatically approve cross listed courses for distributed learning delivery. Separate submissions are required for each course. (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf)
Do prerequisites have to be enforced in Banner?,"Prerequisites do not have to be enforced in Banner. However, it is recommended that they be enforced, as they are published in the Bulletin. It creates inconsistency in University sources to list prerequisites on the Bulletin, but then not enforce them in Banner."
How do Carolina Core Overlay courses work?,"Carolina Core overlay courses meet two Carolina Core learning outcomes in one course. Students may apply a maximum of two overlay courses to their Carolina Core hours. All students must have a minimum of 31 hours of Carolina Core. For a list of overlay-eligible courses, visit the Carolina Core website and sort by the Overlay column in the table.

"If my program has multiple concentrations, will a change to the program affect all of the concentrations?","Concentrations are specific areas of study within the major. Anything outside of a concentration is part of the base program. If the change is to the Carolina Core, College Requirements, Program Requirements, or Major requirements (outside of the concentration), then the change will affect all concentrations. If the change is within a specific concentration itself, then it will not affect other concentrations in the program."
What are critical courses on the major maps?,"Courses may be marked as critical if there is a deadline for completion or if they may cause a delay in graduation because they serve as a prerequisite in a series of courses, have prescribed sequencing, or have limited offerings. There is a description of why courses are critical for a particular program in the first program note on the back of each major map. Critical courses are explained with examples in the Major Maps Training Module . (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8iJrJTDzKCQ&feature=youtu.be)"
What are major maps?,"A major map is a layout of required courses in a given program of study, including critical courses and suggested course sequence to ensure a clear path to graduation.

What is a cognate?,"""A cognate is series of courses that display a distinct curricular pattern in one or more disciplines different from the major. Undergraduate cognates require a minimum of 12 credit hours in advanced level courses related to, but outside the major. Graduate cognates range between 9 and 18 credit hours. Cognates are variable according to what is appropriate as determined by the student and the major advisor. Thus, cognates are not subject to faculty governance review, and do not appear on either the transcripts or the diplomas."" (ACAF 2.00)"
What is a concentration?,"""A Concentration is a series of courses that display a distinct curricular pattern within the major. They are often called options, emphases, tracks, areas, fields, or specializations. These are different from minors or cognates which are typically outside of the major. Concentrations are subject to faculty governance review, and appear on the transcripts but not the diplomas."" (ACAF 2.00)"
What is an integrative course?,"An Integrative course is a course in the major, in which selected Carolina Core learning outcomes are integrated into the chosen major. Each undergraduate program must have an approved integrative course and require it as part of the major to ensure that all undergraduate students have had an integrative course in their major.

"When do cross-listed courses require additional proposals, and not just letters of concurrence?","Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Anytime a course is being deleted. If multiple cross-listed courses are being deleted, separate proposals are needed. Anytime a new course is being created. If a new course is to be cross listed with another new course, two proposals are needed (one for each course). If a new course is going to be cross listed with an existing course, only one proposal is needed. The proposal that creates the new course can also create the cross list, but does need a letter of concurrency. (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf)"
When is a syllabus required for a proposal?,"Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: A syllabus should only be included in a proposal when necessary. When a syllabus is included, it will be reviewed by the Committee on Curricula and Courses. Proposals that require a syllabus: New course Significant change in the course description, and/or title When required by other committees (i.e., Carolina Core and Instructional Development -INDEV) Proposals that do not require a syllabus: Minor revisions to the course description or course title (e.g., slight rephrasing to replace terms as dictated by professional organizations often related to accreditation) Change in co-requisites or pre-requisites Change in course level, as long as not changing to/from 500 or 600. Change in Catalog Restrictions Change in Carolina Core or GLD designations Change in Grade Mode (not needed for removing pass/fail; needed if adding pass/fail) Change in Schedule Type (e.g., adding/changing lecture/lab/practicum format] Deleting a course (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf)"
When is the content in my proposal effective?,"New courses, programs, and concentrations can be effective for the next term after all approvals and notifications.

Why do Faculty need to know about DegreeWorks?,"Every undergraduate student has access to his/her personal degree audit. This in important because students monitor their own progress. Degree audits are especially important for athletes, veterans, and OSP (Opportunity Scholars Program) students, who must have an accurate degree audit for compliance (NCAA, GI Bill, Federal Funding). Faculty need to be aware of this because curricular decisions must be accurately reflected in DegreeWorks."
Will my proposal require a letter of concurrence?,"Under ACAF 2.00: Interdisciplinary or Interprofessional Programs : Each instance in which an interdisciplinary or interprofessional program is created, revised, or terminated requires letters of concurrence from all related academic units. Dual, Joint and Other Collaborative Degree Programs: The proposal requires the approval of the faculty and leadership in both or all collaborating programs, and letters of concurrence from all university units in closely related disciplines. Under ACAF 2.03: Course Actions : If a course action has the potential to impact the curriculum offering of other units or campuses, then the proponent is responsible for procuring concurrence from such units or campuses. Cross-listed course: If one course is new, and the other already exists, the unit introducing the new course shall include a statement of concurrence from the unit with the existing course. If all courses in a cross-listing are existing courses, one of the units shall submit the course action, indicating all other courses with which the course is cross-listed. All other units shall provide to the initiating unit statements of concurrence, indicating all other courses with which the initiated course is cross-listed. Common Reasons Proposals are Returned from the Curricula and Courses Committee: Pre-/Co-Requisites : Changes to Pre-/Co-requisites (either their addition or removal) require a letter of concurrence for the department offering the pre-/co-requisite course unless the impacted courses are in the same department as the subject course. (https://sc.edu/about/offices_and_divisions/provost/planning/academicprograms/docs/f23232.pdf)"
Will my proposal require any external approvals?,"Only programs require external approvals (the President, Board of Trustees (BoT), SACS, and CHE notification or approval), as outline in ACAF 2.00: ""All new academic programs and program name changes across the entire USC system must be approved by the president. All new academic programs and program name changes across the entire USC system must be approved by the University Board of Trustees."" CHE approval is required in the following cases: New degree programs; New academic certificates of any length in a new CIP code; New academic certificates of more than 18 credit hours in a current CIP code; Program revisions of more than 18 credit hours including the addition of one or more program concentrations and CIP code changes; Program revisions of delivery location to off-campus (50% or more of credit hours); Extension of an approved health professions program to additional sites in-state, and Center and institute proposals requesting new or additional state funding. CHE notification is required in the following cases: Program revisions of 18 credit hours or less (undergraduate) or 12 credit hours or less (graduate), including the addition of a single program concentration; New academic certificates of 18 credit hours or less in a current CIP code; Consolidation of concentrations within an existing program; Program name changes; Program four-letter designator changes; Program terminations; Program revisions of delivery method to distance education delivery (50% or more of credit hours); and Center or institute proposals in which state funding is not required. SACSCOC approval is required six months before implementation in the following cases: New programs, including new dual or joint degree programs; Program revisions that increase program length by 10%; New academic certificates of any length in any CIP code; Program terminations; Program revisions of delivery location to off-campus (50% or more of credit hours); and Program revisions of delivery method to distance education delivery (50% or more of credit hours) SACSCOC notification is required six months before implementation in the following cases: Program revisions of delivery location to off-campus (25% to 49% of credit hours); Program name changes. The program percentages must be based on the total number of credits required to earn the degree, not on the number of required credits in the major, minor or course, or the number of contact hours. SACSCOC may also request more information or additional materials such as a prospectus for any action."
